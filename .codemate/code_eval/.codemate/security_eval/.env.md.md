# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This report outlines security vulnerabilities detected in the provided code, focusing exclusively on security and sensitive data exposure issues.

---

## 1. Hardcoded Secrets and Credentials

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Database and email credentials, as well as JWT secrets, are directly hardcoded in the code.
- Secrets in source code are prone to accidental exposure through version control, code sharing, or insider threat.
- This enables attackers with code access to easily compromise database and authentication mechanisms.

**Remediation:**
- Replace all hardcoded secrets with environment variables.
- Secrets should be kept outside the codebase and loaded from secure sources at runtime (e.g., `.env` file, secret manager).

---

## 2. Sensitive Data Exposure in Client-Side Code

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Exporting sensitive credentials (e.g., JWT secret) to code accessible from the client-side makes it trivial for threat actors to obtain secrets.
- Compromises the integrity of applications relying on client/server separation.

**Remediation:**
- Ensure that sensitive credentials and secrets are only accessible in server-side code.
- Never include authentication or database credentials in client-side bundles or public API responses.

---

## 3. Lack of Secret Protection and Version Control Exclusion

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Secrets may be checked into version control systems (such as Git) inadvertently.
- No mechanism in place to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

**Remediation:**
- Store all secrets in environment files and ensure `.env` files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- Provide `.env.example` without real values for environment documentation.

---

## 4. Weak Environment Variable Management

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Fallback values for critical URLs and ports can inadvertently expose dev credentials or endpoints.
- Inconsistent naming for environment variables can confuse security audits, automated scans, and developer usage.

**Remediation:**
- Define clear environment variable naming conventions (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for secrets/credentials).
- Avoid including sensitive defaults in fallbacks; fail securely when environment variables are missing.

---

## 5. Absence of Secret Rotation and Secure Storage Solution

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Static credentials are rarely rotated, leaving them at risk if leaked.
- No mention of secure vaults or secret manager integrations for runtime credential fetching.

**Remediation:**
- Integrate a secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Design processes for periodic secret rotation and minimal privileged access.

---

## 6. JWT Settings Not Validated

**Vulnerabilities:**
- JWT expiry settings are injected from environment variables without format checks.
- Potential for misconfiguration resulting in insecure authentication tokens.

**Remediation:**
- Validate environment variable values (e.g., JWT_EXPIRES_IN) on initialization.
- Implement fail-fast logic for invalid JWT settings.

---

## 7. Default Port Usage Without Parametrization

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Using fixed port numbers increases the risk of port collision and may unintentionally expose local dev services.
- Does not allow for secure randomization or configuration per environment.

**Remediation:**
- Always derive ports from environment variables with safe fallback logic.

---

## 8. Overall Recommendations

- Remove all secrets from code/config files immediately.
- Use environment variables or secure secret management platforms.
- Audit codebase for existing leaks and update access policies.
- Enforce robust configuration and access controls for credentials.

**Immediate attention to these vulnerabilities is required to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and non-compliance with security best practices.**
