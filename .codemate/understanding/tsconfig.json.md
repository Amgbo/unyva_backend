High-Level Documentation: TypeScript Configuration File

Overview:
This configuration file ("tsconfig.json") sets up the environment for a TypeScript project. It specifies how TypeScript should interpret and compile the source code and which files are included.

Key Features:

- Language Target & Modules: The code is compiled to ES2020 JavaScript syntax and uses ESNext modules for importing/exporting code.
- Module Resolution: Uses "bundler" style resolution, tailored for modern build tools.
- Import Extensions: Allows importing TypeScript files with ".ts" extensions directly.
- Emitting Output: Compilation checks for errors but does not output JavaScript files ("noEmit": true).
- Interoperability: Enables compatibility between CommonJS and ESModules.
- Consistency & Safety: Enforces consistent file name casing, strict type-checking rules, and skips type-checking for external libraries (for speed).
- Paths: Outputs and root directories are set to "dist" and "src" respectively, though no files are emitted because "noEmit" is true.
- Inclusion: Only files in the "src" directory and its subfolders are included for compilation.

Use Case:
This configuration is ideal for projects where TypeScript is used purely for type-checking and development, without generating compiled JavaScript files in the "dist" folder (such as when using modern bundlers that handle compilation separately).

Conclusion:
The file ensures robust type-checking, maintains code quality, and speeds up development by streamlining the TypeScript workflow without generating output files.
