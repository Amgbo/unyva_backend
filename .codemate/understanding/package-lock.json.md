# unyva-backend: High-Level Documentation

This project, **unyva-backend**, is a Node.js backend application, likely using TypeScript and Express 5. It appears to be designed with cloud integration, file uploads, authentication, PostgreSQL database access, and modern JavaScript tooling and safety features.

---

## Core Technologies & Libraries

- **Node.js & TypeScript**: Type-safe backend development, leveraging recent Node.js features (requires Node >=18).
- **Express 5**: Fast, unopinionated REST API framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Zod**: Runtime validation and type checking of API request/response data.
- **PostgreSQL (pg)**: Relational database driver for database interactions.

## Major Functionalities Enabled by Dependencies

1. **Authentication & Security**
   - **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing.
   - **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token generation and validation for stateless authentication.
   - **cors**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware for API security.
   - **dotenv**: Secure, environment-based configuration.

2. **File Uploads & Cloud Storage**
   - **multer**: Handling multipart/form-data, especially file uploads.
   - **cloudinary**: Cloud-based image/file storage.
   - **multer-storage-cloudinary**: Bridging Multer file uploads and Cloudinary storage.

3. **Database Connectivity**
   - **pg**: Official PostgreSQL client for Node.js, supports modern async patterns.

4. **Development Tooling**
   - **typescript**: Type-safe development.
   - **nodemon**: Auto-restart server on code changes during development.
   - **ts-node**: Run TypeScript files directly.
   - **cross-env**: Ensure environment variables work across OSes.
   - **@types/\***: Provides TypeScript type definitions for strongly typed coding.

5. **Utilities & Polyfills**
   - **lodash**: Utility functions for array, object, and function manipulation.
   - **core-js**: Polyfills for modern JavaScript features.

## Typical Use Cases Inferred

- **User management**: Registration, login, password hashing, JWT-based sessionless authentication.
- **REST API**: Validated data exchange using Express + Zod.
- **Image/File upload**: Accepts files via multipart requests, stores them directly to Cloudinary.
- **Data persistence**: CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database.
- **Dev UX**: Fast feedback loop with live reloading, TypeScript typing, and type-safe environment variables.

---

## Development Lifecycle

- During development, use **nodemon** & **ts-node** for restarting and running TypeScript code directly.
- Source code likely written in TypeScript, using type definitions for all major dependencies.
- Test and run locally with cross-platform support for environment configuration (cross-env).
- Validation and error handling enhanced through Zod and robust typing.

---

## Project Structure (Implied)

- Separation of logic related to authentication, uploads, and database connectivity.
- Environment variables stored in a `.env` file (managed by dotenv).
- TypeScript config to define build/transpile options.

---

## Summary

**unyva-backend** is a robust, cloud-enabled backend, suitable for modern web/mobile applications requiring secure authentication, reliable file storage, and scalable data management. It leverages industry-standard practices in authentication, file handling, validation, and developer productivity.
