High-Level Documentation

Overview:
The provided code snippet represents an environment configuration file, likely used in a Node.js or React Native/Expo application. It defines essential environment variables needed for the backend and frontend operation, including settings for the server port, database connectivity, email authentication, JWT-based authentication, and the application's base URL.

Key Variables:

- PORT: Specifies the port number (5000) on which the server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.

- DATABASE_URL: Contains the PostgreSQL database connection string, including credentials, host, port, and database name.

- EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS: Provide the email account credentials used for sending emails from the application (such as verification, password resets, notifications, etc.).

- JWT_SECRET: Defines a secret key used to sign JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens for secure authentication and session management.

- JWT_EXPIRES_IN: Indicates the validity period (7 days) for issued JWT tokens before they expire.

- BASE_URL: Exports the application's base API URL, prioritizing the EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL from environment variables (if present), or defaults to 'http://localhost:5000'. This is essential for making API requests from the frontend.

Usage Context:
This configuration is typical for full-stack web applications with:
- A backend (likely Node.js/Express) connected to a PostgreSQL database.
- Email integration for user communication.
- JWT authentication management.
- A frontend, possibly built with React Native and Expo, which needs to know the backend API's base URL for communication.

Security Note:
This file contains sensitive credentials and secrets. In a real-world deployment, this information should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables, secret managers) and never committed to version control.
