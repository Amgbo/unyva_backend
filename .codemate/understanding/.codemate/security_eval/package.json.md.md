# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

This report analyzes the provided high-level documentation of the **unyva-backend** project for potential security vulnerabilities based on described technologies, features, and practices. The review is scoped only to security-relevant documentation aspects and does not include the unseen underlying source code.

---

## 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

- **JWT (jsonwebtoken):**
    - **Potential Risk:** If JWTs are not signed with a *strong, secret key* (managed securely e.g., via environment variables), there is a risk of token forgery.
    - **Potential Risk:** No mention of JWT expiry; if tokens do not expire or have appropriate short lifespans, stolen tokens could be used indefinitely.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensure tokens are signed with strong, unpredictable secrets fetched from secure environment variables. Use short expiry (`exp`) fields and refresh tokens if needed.

- **bcrypt:**
    - **Potential Risk:** If bcrypt salt rounds are set too low, password hashes could be brute-forced more easily, or if legacy passwords are imported insecurely.
    - **Mitigation:** Use at least 10–12 rounds for bcrypt hashing. Ensure salts are unique per password.

---

## 2. **Input Validation**

- **zod:**
    - **Positive:** Input validation reduces attack surfaces (e.g., injection, XSS), providing type and schema checks.
    - **Potential Gap:** The documentation does not specify that *all* user input is validated, especially file uploads or query parameters.
    - **Mitigation:** Enforce comprehensive validation on all incoming data, particularly for fields affecting DB queries or file storage.

---

## 3. **File Uploads**

- **multer, multer-storage-cloudinary, cloudinary:**
    - **Potential Risk:** Without strict file validation and controls, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., executable files, malware, scripts).
    - **Mitigation:** Restrict accepted file types, implement size limits, sanitize file names, and validate files both server-side and, where possible, at the cloud storage service.

---

## 4. **Database Management**

- **pg, PostgreSQL:**
    - **Potential Risk:** If user input is interpolated directly into SQL queries, there’s a risk of SQL injection.
    - **Mitigation:** Always use parameterized queries or ORM with escaping. Avoid dynamic query construction with unsanitized user input.

---

## 5. **Environment Variable Management**

- **dotenv:**
    - **Potential Risk:** Sensitive values (secrets, DB credentials, JWT keys) must not be hardcoded or committed to source control. Exposure of `.env` files can lead to full compromise.
    - **Mitigation:** Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`. Rotate secrets regularly.

---

## 6. **CORS Handling**

- **cors:**
    - **Potential Risk:** Overly permissive CORS settings (`origin: *`) allow any domain to access the API, increasing XSS and CSRF attack surfaces.
    - **Mitigation:** Restrict CORS origins to only trusted domains. Use credentials flags cautiously.

---

## 7. **Deployment Considerations**

- **General:**
    - **Risk:** No mention of HTTPS/TLS enforcement, security headers (e.g., Helmet), or rate limiting.
    - **Mitigation:** Serve API only over HTTPS. Set security headers and enable rate limiting to prevent brute-force and DoS attacks.
    - **Risk:** No description of logging/monitoring for security events (e.g., auth failures).
    - **Mitigation:** Implement audit logs for sensitive actions and failed logins.

---

## 8. **Dev Dependencies in Production**

- **General:**
    - **Risk:** Installing or executing dev dependencies (e.g., nodemon, ts-node, @types/*) in production environments can increase attack surfaces.
    - **Mitigation:** In production, only install production dependencies.

---

## 9. **Out-of-Scope/Unaddressed Concerns**

- **Session Hijacking/CSRF:**
    - No mention of measures against session hijacking or CSRF for web clients; typically mitigated with tokens in HTTP-only cookies and appropriate headers.

- **Error Handling and Information Disclosure:**
    - No details about error handling—uncaught exceptions may leak stack traces or sensitive info in API responses.

# **Recommendations**

1. Harden JWT implementation by enforcing short expiries and strong secrets from secure environment management.
2. Validate *all* incoming data and parameters using `zod` or equivalent, especially for anything passed to the DB or file system.
3. Lock down CORS: only allow trusted origins.
4. Restrict file uploads by type, size, and location, and never allow execution.
5. Always use parameterized DB queries.
6. Never commit `.env` or any secrets to source control. Use robust secret rotation policies.
7. Serve API endpoints over HTTPS with appropriate headers (e.g., via [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/)).
8. Separate production and development dependencies.
9. Implement robust error handling to prevent leaking internal details.
10. Audit and log all sensitive operations (logins, password resets, privilege changes).
