# Industry Standards & Code Review Report

## Overall Feedback

- The documentation is clear and covers each configuration.
- There is good separation of environment-sensitive variables.
- However, **critical best practice issues, security suggestions, and optimizations** are noted below.

## Issues & Recommendations

### 1. **Hardcoding Sensitive Information**

**Issue:**  
Sensitive data like `DATABASE_URL`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`, and `JWT_SECRET` should never be directly set in the code/config file. They must be loaded from environment variables or secrets management tools for security.

**Suggested Code (Pseudo Code):**

```pseudo
DATABASE_URL = ENV['DATABASE_URL']    # Never hardcode connection strings
EMAIL_USER   = ENV['EMAIL_USER']      # Load sender email from env
EMAIL_PASS   = ENV['EMAIL_PASS']      # Load password from env
JWT_SECRET   = ENV['JWT_SECRET']      # Load JWT secret from env
```

### 2. **Port Configuration Flexibility**

**Issue:**  
Port is hardcoded to `5000`. For deployment flexibility (especially on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, etc.), use an environment variable and a default fallback.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
PORT = ENV['PORT'] or 5000
```

---

### 3. **JWT Expiry Value**

**Issue:**  
`JWT_EXPIRES_IN` is statically set to `'7d'`. To adjust for different environments (staging, prod, dev), allow this to be set via environment variable.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
JWT_EXPIRES_IN = ENV['JWT_EXPIRES_IN'] or '7d'
```

---

### 4. **BASE_URL Configuration**

**Issue:**  
Using `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is good, but name is framework-specific. Consider supporting more generic variable names as fallback, such as `API_BASE_URL`, for increased portability.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
BASE_URL = ENV['EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL'] or ENV['API_BASE_URL'] or 'http://localhost:5000'
```

---

### 5. **Environment Variable Validation**

**Issue:**  
No checks are performed to ensure required environment variables are set (e.g., JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS). If missing, the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
if not DATABASE_URL: 
    raise Error("DATABASE_URL is required.")

if not EMAIL_USER or not EMAIL_PASS: 
    raise Error("EMAIL credentials are required.")

if not JWT_SECRET: 
    raise Error("JWT_SECRET is required.")
```

---

### 6. **Configuration Export Pattern**

**Issue:**  
Ensure all configuration constants are bundled in a single exported object or module for maintainability.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
config = {
     "PORT": PORT,
     "DATABASE_URL": DATABASE_URL,
     "EMAIL_USER": EMAIL_USER,
     "EMAIL_PASS": EMAIL_PASS,
     "JWT_SECRET": JWT_SECRET,
     "JWT_EXPIRES_IN": JWT_EXPIRES_IN,
     "BASE_URL": BASE_URL
}
export config
```

## **Summary Table**

| Issue                        | Severity   | Recommendation    |
|------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Hardcoded secrets            | Critical   | Use env vars      |
| Static port                  | Major      | Add env fallback  |
| JWT expiry static            | Major      | Use env fallback  |
| BASE_URL env naming          | Minor      | Add generic fallback |
| Env var validation           | Major      | Throw error if missing |
| Config organization/export   | Minor      | Group for export  |

## **Conclusion**

**Addressing these recommendations will bring the config file up to modern software engineering standardsâ€”improving security, maintainability, and portability.**
