# High-Level Documentation: TypeScript Configuration

This TypeScript configuration defines how the TypeScript compiler behaves for the project.

---

## Overall Purpose

- Provides **strict type-checking** for all TypeScript source files in the `src` directory.
- Does **not** produce compiled JavaScript output filesâ€”type checking only.
- Targets **modern JavaScript environments** and module systems.

---

## Key Aspects

- **Target and Modules**
  - Configured to output code compatible with **ES2020**.
  - Uses **ESNext** module syntax for modern import/export features.

- **Module Resolution**
  - Adopts a module resolution strategy suitable for **bundlers** (like webpack, Vite).
  - Allows importing files with `.ts` extensions.

- **Type Checking**
  - Enforces **strict type-checking** for increased code safety.
  - Skips type checking of definition files in libraries to speed up builds.

- **Interop & Consistency**
  - Supports interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules.
  - Enforces **case-sensitive file naming**.

- **Paths**
  - Specifies `src` as the **source directory** and `dist` as the **output directory** (though no code is emitted).
  - Only files inside `src` are included for type-checking.

---

## Intended Use

- Best for **modern TypeScript codebases** using new JavaScript features.
- Designed for development environments using **external tools** for building/bundling.
- Ensures type safety without generating output files during development.

---

**Summary:**  
This configuration enables robust type checking on source files in `src`, ensures compatibility with contemporary JavaScript language features, and integrates smoothly with modern front-end toolchains or bundlers.
