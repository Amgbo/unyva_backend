# High-Level Documentation

This configuration file establishes core environment variables and constants essential for the application's operation. Its primary purposes and components are:

1. **Server Listening Port**  
   - Assigns the network port (typically `5000`) used by the application to receive and handle HTTP requests.

2. **Database Connectivity**  
   - Defines the PostgreSQL database connection string, encompassing the database server's address, credentials, and database name, to enable data storage and retrieval.

3. **Email Service Credentials**  
   - Sets environment variables for the email system, including the sender's email address and password, allowing the application to dispatch notification or account-related emails.

4. **JWT Authentication Settings**  
   - Provides the secret key for generating and validating JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), along with an expiration period (such as 7 days), underpinning secure authentication and user sessions.

5. **API Base URL Configuration**  
   - Exports a `BASE_URL` constant, assigning it a value from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` if specified in the environment; otherwise, it defaults to a local server address. This sets the root endpoint used by clients and internal services to access the backend API.

**Overall Purpose:**  
These configuration values collectively permit the application to:
- Interact securely with its database,
- Send emails for user communication,
- Manage authentication via token-based security,
- Configure a consistent API entry point for both development and production environments.
