# High-Level Documentation: unyva-backend

## Overview

**unyva-backend** is a TypeScript-based backend server, built on Node.js and Express. It provides RESTful API endpoints to support client applications, with core features for authentication, data storage, file uploads, validation, and secure environment configuration. Its modular design enables scalable development and maintainable production deployments.

---

## Core Components and Architecture

1. **Express REST API Server**
   - Handles HTTP requests/responses, routing, and middleware application.

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Enables static typing for reliability and maintainability.

3. **Database Layer**
   - Utilizes PostgreSQL via the `pg` driver for relational data management.

4. **Authentication & Security**
   - Employs JWT for stateless authentication and `bcrypt` for secure password hashing.

5. **Media/File Management**
   - Supports file uploads both to local storage and Cloudinary, using `multer` and related storage drivers.

6. **Input Validation**
   - Leverages `zod` for schema-based validation of incoming data.

7. **Configuration & Environment Management**
   - Uses `dotenv` for secure runtime configuration via environment variables.

8. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
   - Handles cross-origin requests to securely expose API endpoints.

9. **Developer Tooling**
   - Supports TypeScript live compilation and hot-reloading workflows for faster development iterations.

---

## Typical Development Workflow

- **Entry Point:** The app starts at `src/index.ts`.
- **Run in Development:** Use `npm run dev` to launch the API server with on-the-fly TypeScript support.
- **Live Reloading:** Integrated with `nodemon` for automatic restarts on changes.

---

## Primary Use Cases

- User registration, login, and session management
- Secure access to protected routes using JWT
- Database CRUD operations with PostgreSQL
- File uploads, including cloud integration for media
- Robust input validation and error handling

---

## Recommended Practices & Security

- Implements encryption for credentials and session tokens.
- Enforces strong validation and type safety.
- Applies CORS policies for controlled API access.
- Relies on environment variables to protect secrets and configuration.

## Dependencies (Major)

- `express`, `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, `multer`, `cloudinary`, `zod`, `dotenv`, `cors`, and TypeScript tooling.
