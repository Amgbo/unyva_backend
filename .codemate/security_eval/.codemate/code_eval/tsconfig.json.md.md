# Industry Review – `tsconfig.json` Security Analysis

## Critical Assessment

Your report accurately covers the main security-sensitive settings in `tsconfig.json`. Below are some **additional industry best practice notes** and corrections for potential weaknesses in your configuration and the review logic.

---

## Detected Issues & Improved Recommendations

#### 1. **allowImportingTsExtensions: true**
- **Issue:** Allowing `.ts` extensions in imports is **dangerous in production**. It may let uncompiled or unverified TypeScript files be imported at runtime, increasing attack surface.
- **Correction (pseudo-code):**
    ```json
    // tsconfig.json (Production)
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": false
    ```
    > Set this to `false` for production builds and validate using automated lint steps.

---

#### 2. **skipLibCheck: true**
- **Issue:** Skipping lib checks may lead to type vulnerabilities, since broken or malicious types in dependencies won't be surfaced by the compiler.
- **Correction (pseudo-code):**
    ```json
    // tsconfig.json (Production)
    "skipLibCheck": false
    ```
    > Always disable in production; optionally enable in dev for faster iteration. Document rationale for deviation in README/ADR.

---

#### 3. **esModuleInterop: true**
- **Industry Note:** Setting `esModuleInterop` to `true` is common, but can mask import incompatibilities. In highly regulated environments, **audit all imports, ban legacy/ambiguous imports, and use static analysis tools.**
- **Suggested check (pseudo-code):**
    ```
    // During code review (CI step)
    IF import statement uses deprecated syntax THEN reject CI build
    ```
    > Integrate static import linting (e.g., `eslint-plugin-import/no-ambiguous`).

---

#### 4. **moduleResolution: bundler**
- **Issue:** Non-default module resolution can pick up unintended files. Risk increases in monorepos or if `node_modules`/test files present in non-standard places.
- **Correction (pseudo-code):**
    ```
    // Pre-build step
    IF (unrecognized file found in input graph) THEN halt build and alert security
    ```
    > Add automated pre-build script checking file inclusion against an allow-list.

---

#### 5. **rootDir / outDir**
- **Industry Note:** If not properly set, you risk leaking source (intellectual property) or internal configs to public/CDN.
- **Correction (pseudo-code):**
    ```json
    // tsconfig.json
    "rootDir": "./src"
    "outDir": "./dist"
    ```
    > Automate directory checks in your release pipeline (fail build if `dist` contains files from outside `src`).

---

#### 6. **General Recommendations (automation and monitoring)**
- **Add enforcement in CI/CD:** Integrate configuration validation scripts.
    ```
    // CI pipeline step
    FOR each tsconfig.json setting in [critical list]
        IF value is insecure THEN fail build and require approval
    ```

---

## Additional Notes

- **Do not use broad wildcards in file includes/excludes.**
    ```json
    // tsconfig.json
    "include": ["src/**/*"]
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
    ```

- **Always lock tsconfig versions between teams and environments for consistency; audit with tools like `tsconfig-lint`.**

## Summary Table Update (Industry Standards)

| **Setting**                  | **Value (Production)**      | **Recommended Value**      | **Comments**                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `allowImportingTsExtensions` | `true`                      | `false`                    | Disable for production                 |
| `skipLibCheck`               | `true`                      | `false`                    | Enable full type checking              |
| `esModuleInterop`            | `true`                      | `true (with audit)`        | Audit imports, ban ambiguous patterns  |
| `moduleResolution`           | `bundler`                   | `bundler` (if necessary)   | Add input file allow-list, audit config|
| `rootDir`, `outDir`          | Custom paths                | `./src`, `./dist`          | Validate: no leaks to public/CDN       |
| Others                       | --                          | --                         | Do not use broad wildcards             |

## Conclusion

Your initial report is thorough, but **industry best practice demands automated enforcement** of “secure defaults” via CI/CD, import linting, and configuration validation. All corrections above should be considered for existing pipelines. **Regular audits and systemized checks** greatly reduce supply-chain and misconfiguration risks.

**Insert the above pseudo-code corrections into your build, CI/CD, and documentation to ensure robust security and compliance.**
