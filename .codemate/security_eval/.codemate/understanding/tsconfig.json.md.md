# High-Level Documentation: Security Vulnerability Report for `tsconfig.json`

This document provides a high-level overview of a security analysis against key settings in a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`). The focus is on assessing options that have an impact on software security posture and supply-chain integrity.

## Purpose

The goal is to identify TypeScript compiler options within `tsconfig.json` that may introduce or conceal security vulnerabilities during the build process, especially in production environments.

## Key Configuration Areas Covered

- **Module Import Extensions**: 
  - Related to whether `.ts` files can be imported directly and the risks of doing so.
- **Type Checking of Dependencies**: 
  - Especially for third-party libraries and how skipping type checks can let vulnerabilities slip.
- **Module Interoperability**: 
  - How mixing ESModule and CommonJS imports can obscure insecure code or mislead dependency resolution.
- **Module Resolution Strategy**: 
  - How bundler-driven resolution can lead to unintended dependencies being included.
- **Build Directory Configuration**: 
  - Risks associated with misconfigured source/output paths potentially exposing sensitive files.

## General Security Risks Identified

- **Supply-Chain Attacks**: Settings allowing direct `.ts` imports and skipping type checks can increase the projectâ€™s attack surface.
- **Unintended File Exposure**: Misconfigured root or output directories may result in accidental deployment of sensitive files.
- **Unsafe Imports**: Enabling certain module interop features without careful auditing can obscure problematic dependencies.
- **Dependency Trust**: Using bundler resolution could pull in files unexpectedly, requiring stringent audit of build processes and dependencies.

## Recommended Mitigations

- Favor importing compiled JavaScript files over TypeScript in production.
- Do not skip type checks on libraries when security is critical.
- Carefully audit import patterns and review third-party modules for safety.
- Keep build and bundler configurations tightly controlled.
- Include directory validation as part of the release pipeline.

## Conclusion

TypeScript configuration settings, while not executable code themselves, can influence how safely or unsafely code is built and deployed. Regular auditing and stricter settings are recommended for production environments to reduce security risks stemming from misconfiguration or third-party dependency issues.
