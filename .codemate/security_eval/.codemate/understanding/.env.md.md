# High-Level Documentation

This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities identified in the project's configuration files and code related to secrets management, authentication, and endpoint exposure. The analysis highlights risks posed by hardcoded credentials, password reuse, JWT handling, unencrypted communication, and a lack of secret rotation.

## Key Areas Addressed

1. **Secrets and Credentials Management**
   - Sensitive data such as database passwords, email credentials, and JWT secrets are stored directly in environment files or code.
   - Risks: Exposure through codebase leaks, accidental commits, or misconfigured deployments.
   - Recommendation: Use secure secret storage solutions and ensure secrets are not included in source control.

2. **Password Security**
   - The same password is reused for multiple services (database and email).
   - Risks: Compromise of one service may cascade to others; increases vulnerability.
   - Recommendation: Use unique, strong, randomly generated passwords for each service.

3. **JWT Authentication Security**
   - JWT secrets are stored insecurely and lack rotation.
   - Risks: Attackers could forge tokens and access protected resources.
   - Recommendation: Store JWT secrets securely, rotate secrets, and use short token lifespans.

4. **API Endpoint Security**
   - API base URL may default to HTTP.
   - Risks: Communications over HTTP are vulnerable to interception and tampering.
   - Recommendation: Enforce the use of HTTPS in all environments.

5. **Secret Rotation and Expiry**
   - Limited token expiry and no clear rotation policy for other secrets.
   - Risks: Prolonged exploitation window if credentials are compromised.
   - Recommendation: Implement regular secret rotation, short-lived tokens, and abnormal access monitoring.

## Actionable Best Practices

- Remove hardcoded secrets from the codebase and deployment files.
- Adopt secret management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Define strong password policies and avoid reuse.
- Mandate HTTPS for all API communications.
- Rotate authentication tokens and credentials routinely.
- Monitor for suspicious activity and educate the team on secure secret handling.

## Summary Table of Risks & Mitigations

| Issue                      | Risk   | Remediation                      |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials      | High   | Secure secret storage, .gitignore|
| Password reuse             | High   | Unique, strong passwords         |
| JWT secret exposure        | High   | Secure storage, rotation         |
| Non-secure API URL         | Medium | Enforce HTTPS                    |
| Lack of secret rotation    | Medium | Regular rotation and expiry      |
