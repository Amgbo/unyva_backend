# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided code for **security vulnerabilities** only.

---

## 1. Hardcoded Sensitive Information

**Findings:**
```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Siderpsk123$@localhost:5432/unyva_db
EMAIL_USER=piussethkwofie@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=Siderpsk123$
JWT_SECRET=87adf76F@#jsY$7mn13!9xdl10aaHH8128sdG
```
**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded plaintext secrets and credentials** are present (database credentials, email password, and JWT secret).
- These are often accidentally pushed to version control or exposed through error logs or misconfiguration, greatly increasing risk of compromise.

**Exploitation:**
- Malicious actors gaining codebase access can extract these secrets to:
    - Compromise the database (read/write/destroy data).
    - Access email account for impersonation or phishing.
    - Sign arbitrary JWT tokens, bypassing authN/Z.

**Mitigations:**
- Never hardcode secrets; load from environment or secret management systems.
- Ensure secrets are not in version control (.gitignore, secrets scanning).
- Regularly rotate all sensitive credentials.

---

## 2. Password Reuse and Weak Secret Management

**Findings:**  
- The same password `Siderpsk123$` is used for both database and email account.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Password reuse** increases risk: compromise of one service can lead to compromise of another.
- Lack of password complexity and management policy.

**Exploitation:**
- If one secret is leaked (e.g. via a database dump), the attacker immediately gains email access as well.

**Mitigations:**
- Generate and use **unique, strong passwords** for each service.
- Enforce rotation and safe storage.

---

## 3. JWT Secret Exposure

**Findings:**  
- `JWT_SECRET` is hardcoded.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- A leaked JWT secret enables attackers to forge authentication tokens, gaining unauthorized access.

**Exploitation:**
- Attackers forge valid JWTs to impersonate any user (including admins).

**Mitigations:**
- Store JWT secrets in secured environment variables or secret stores.
- Rotate JWT secrets and invalidate tokens upon secret change.

---

## 4. Insecure Default API URL

```js
export const BASE_URL = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Defaults to plain HTTP (instead of HTTPS), subjecting traffic to interception or manipulation (MITM).

**Exploitation:**
- Attackers on the same network can read/modify sensitive API requests and responses.

**Mitigations:**
- Default to HTTPS APIs only.
- Validate API URLs in configuration for production readiness.

---

## 5. Insufficient Secret/Token Rotation

**Findings:**
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d` (1 week).
- No rotation strategy evident for other secrets.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Long-lived secrets/tokens increase risk exposure if leaked.

**Exploitation:**
- Stolen tokens or credentials may be valid for a long time, enabling continued unauthorized access.

**Mitigations:**
- Use short-lived JWTs with refresh mechanisms.
- Regularly rotate and expire sensitive credentials.

---

## 6. Exposure by Accidental or Misconfigured Source Control

**Findings:**  
- The format suggests these secrets might exist in all environments, including source control.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- If `.env` or config files are tracked, any collaborator (or external party) could access production credentials.

**Mitigations:**
- Never commit config files with secrets.
- Use pre-commit hooks and automated secret scanning tools.
- Store secrets in dedicated secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability            | Severity | Recommendations                       |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded secrets        | Critical | Use environment variables/secret mgr  |
| Password reuse           | High     | Unique, per-service passwords         |
| JWT secret exposure      | High     | Secret mgmt & rotation                |
| Insecure default API URL | Medium   | Restrict to HTTPS                     |
| Lack of rotation         | Medium   | Rotate secrets and shorten token TTLs  |

---

## Recommendations

- **Remove all plaintext secrets** from source code and configuration files.
- **Utilize secure secret management services** appropriate to deployment environment.
- **Enforce strong, unique credentials** for all services.
- **Mandate HTTPS** endpoints in all environments.
- **Automate secret rotation** and monitor for usage anomalies.
- **Educate all developers** in secure configuration and credential hygiene.

---
*Note: The actual risk also depends on deployment and access control practices outside this configuration.*
