# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Overview

The provided code contains configuration values and environment variables for a web application, including database credentials, email credentials, and JWT secrets. This report highlights security vulnerabilities present in the configuration and recommends mitigation strategies.

---

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. **Hardcoded Secrets**

#### Details:
- Credentials and secrets (e.g., database password, email password, JWT secret) are hardcoded directly into the file:

  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Siderpsk123$@localhost:5432/unyva_db
  EMAIL_PASS=Siderpsk123$
  JWT_SECRET=87adf76F@#jsY$7mn13!9xdl10aaHH8128sdG
  ```

#### Risks:
- Hardcoded secrets make it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access if the file is exposed (through VCS, deployment artifacts, etc.)
- Maintenance and rotation of secrets are more difficult.

#### Recommendations:
- Store secrets in a secure secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Load sensitive values from environment variables at runtime (never commit them).
- Use environment configuration files only in local development, and never in source control.

---

### 2. **Weak Passwords Embedded**

#### Details:
- Passwords such as **Siderpsk123$** for critical services are present.

#### Risks:
- Password can be easily guessed or brute-forced if not complex enough.
- Reuse across services increases risk of cascading breaches.

#### Recommendations:
- Use randomly generated, complex passwords for databases and email services.
- Rotate secrets regularly and avoid using similar passwords for multiple services.

---

### 3. **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Public Repositories**

#### Details:
- If this file is checked into source control, secrets are exposed to all collaborators (and possibly the public).

#### Risks:
- Public exposure leads to potential service compromise, data leakage, and credential stuffing attacks.

#### Recommendations:
- Add sensitive configuration files to `.gitignore`.
- Scan repositories for accidental exposures (tools like GitGuardian).
- Revoke and rotate any secrets found in public or accessible repositories.

---

### 4. **JWT Misconfiguration**

#### Details:
- JWT_SECRET exposed as a plain string.
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN set, but rotating the secret may not be considered.

#### Risks:
- If JWT secret is exposed, attackers can forge authentication tokens.
- Long-lived tokens (`7d`) increase window of exploitation if token or secret is leaked.

#### Recommendations:
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically.
- Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens.
- Store JWT_SECRET in a secure location.

---

### 5. **Connection to Services Over Insecure Channels**

#### Details:
- `BASE_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Risks:
- If deployed in production accidentally with HTTP, it exposes data to MITM attacks.

#### Recommendations:
- Ensure all production connections are over HTTPS.
- Set environment-specific variables to avoid misconfiguration.

---

### 6. **Email Address Exposure**

#### Details:
- Hardcoded `EMAIL_USER` exposes valid email address.

#### Risks:
- Target for phishing, spam, or social engineering attacks.
- Can be correlated with password exposure for account compromise.

#### Recommendations:
- Do not expose real email addresses in sample or production code.
- Use environment variables for email addresses as well.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability Type         | Risk Level | Remediation                                     |
|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded Secrets         | High       | Use environment vars, secrets manager            |
| Weak Passwords            | Medium     | Use strong, random passwords                     |
| Public Exposure           | High       | gitignore sensitive files, monitor leaks         |
| JWT Misconfiguration      | Medium     | Rotate secrets, consider token expiry            |
| Insecure Connections      | Medium     | Use HTTPS, environment-specific config           |
| Email Address Exposure    | Low        | Hide real emails, use env vars                   |

---

## Additional Recommendations

- Implement automated security scanning for configuration files.
- Audit all existing secrets for exposure and rotate if necessary.
- Enforce secret handling policies within development teams.

---

**Note:** If these secrets have already been exposed in any repository or shared location, treat them as compromised and rotate them immediately. Always assume that secrets in infrastructure-as-code have a high risk and must be protected with best practices.
