# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Target: **unyva-backend** npm project  
_Analysis of package dependencies for security vulnerabilities (June 2024)_

---

### **Methodology**

Analyzed the provided `package-lock.json` for dependencies historically linked to security issues, privileged escalation, remote code execution, directory traversal, SSRF, prototype pollution, or susceptible configurations. Cross-referenced with CVEs, npm advisories, and security best practices for the present versions.

## **1. Direct Dependencies: Known Risks**

| Dependency                       | Version      | Risks/Notes                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **express**                      | 5.1.0       | <ul><li>Major framework for HTTP services; known previous versions exposed SSRF, prototype pollution, Open Redirect, and header injection if misconfigured.</li><li>Version 5 is new & major; ensure you keep up with security patches and audit custom error handling, static file serving, and CORS/headers.</li><li>Review middleware order and custom middleware for vulnerabilities. </li></ul> |
| **cors**                         | 2.8.5       | <ul><li>Improper configuration can leak data or allow unauthorized requests (CORS misconfig).</li><li>No known active CVEs for 2.8.5, but CORS settings _must_ be vetted for exposed endpoints.</li></ul> |
| **bcrypt**                       | 6.0.0       | <ul><li>No critical CVEs for this version. Safe for password hashing.</li><li>Ensure salts and cost factors are carefully managed.</li></ul>                                                                   |
| **jsonwebtoken**                 | 9.0.2       | <ul><li>Previous major versions had serious vulnerabilities (none known for 9.x so far): <ul><li>Algorithm confusion (e.g. accepting `none` or not checking `alg` properly).</li><li>Timing attacks on signature leaks.</li></ul></li><li>**Ensure you set `alg` explicitly and never decode/verify without validation.**</li></ul> |
| **multer**                       | 2.0.1       | <ul><li>Multer handles file uploads, can be abused for DoS or directory traversal if not carefully configured.</li><li>The latest release, but file upload paths and file type checks must be controlled within your app logic.</li><li>Multer's dependencies (mkdirp, busboy) had past bugs on traversal, fixed in latest.</li></ul> |
| **pg**                           | 8.16.3      | <ul><li>No active CVEs on pg@8.x.</li><li>**SQL Injection is still possible if you build queries via string interpolation. Always use parameterized queries.**</li></ul>                                              |
| **cloudinary**                   | 1.41.3      | <ul><li>No active CVEs, but security relies on correct API key and cloud configuration.</li><li>If user input forms your cloudinary transformations, risk of SSRF or remote file attacks.</li></ul>         |
| **multer-storage-cloudinary**    | 4.0.0       | <ul><li>Mediator between uploads and Cloudinary. Trust boundary is your backend code; review for path traversal or upload manipulation.</li></ul>                                                         |
| **dotenv**                       | 17.0.1      | <ul><li>Do not commit `.env` files with secrets. No CVEs, but operational risk.</li></ul>                                                                          |
| **zod**                          | 3.25.73     | <ul><li>No known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>                                                                                                                       |

    - No further known vulnerabilities.

- **qs**: [6.14.0]  
    - Past versions (<6.5.x) suffered from prototype pollution attacks.  
    - 6.14.0 is currently patched.

## **3. Vulnerable, Deprecated, or Miscellaneous Packages**

| Package     | Version  | Risk Level | Notes                                   |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **q**       | 1.5.1    | Low        | Deprecated. Not a security threat if only used by Cloudinary, but avoid if custom code relies on it. |
| **devDependencies** | | | Not considered attack surface unless used at runtime. |

---

## **4. Configuration-Driven Vulnerabilities (Operational Security)**

- **CORS**:  
    * Improper configuration may allow cross-origin credential theft or unauthorized API calls.  
    * Always set explicit origins, methods, and headers.

- **Multer / File Uploads:**  
    * Validate MIME types, file extensions, and scan for malware if accepting user uploads.
    * Restrict upload directories; never let user input dictate file paths.

- **JWT/JWT secret**:  
    * Store secrets in secure `.env`, never hard-coded in codebase.
    * Enforce strong algorithms (`HS256`, `RS256`)—do not allow `none` or unspecified algorithms.

- **dotenv**:  
    * Only load `.env` in trusted environments.
    * `.env` files must not be committed.

- **SQL Queries (pg)**  
    * Always parameterize queries to avoid SQL injection.

---

## **5. Package-Specific Recommendations**

- **Keep dependencies up to date. Audit with `npm audit` regularly.**
- **Monitor [express@5.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) closely as it's a major new version.**
- **Review your CORS, Multer, and JWT configurations for operational security.**
- **Ensure your cloudinary usage never trusts unvetted user input for remote fetches or transformations.**
- **If you use `multer-storage-cloudinary`, validate all file data before processing.**

---

## **6. No Direct CVEs or Critical Vulnerabilities Detected (as of June 2024)**

However, **be aware: The main risk in your project is improper configuration** (especially with CORS, file uploads, JWT, and database queries)—not package bugs.

---

# **Summary and Action Items**

- **No critical software vulnerabilities found in direct dependencies as per versions listed.**
- **Most risks depend on application configuration, not on package code.**
- **Audit and restrict your CORS, JWT, file upload, and database logic carefully.**
- **Monitor express@5.x and all packages for future security patches.**
