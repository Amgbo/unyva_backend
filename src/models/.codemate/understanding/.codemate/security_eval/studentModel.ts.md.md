# Security Vulnerabilities Report: `studentModel.ts`

This report analyzes only the code aspects described for `studentModel.ts` in terms of **security vulnerabilities**. As the source code is not fully provided, assessment is based on the described behavior and typical implementation patterns.

---

## 1. Password Storage & Handling

### **Vulnerability: Plaintext Password Storage**
- The documentation for `updateStudentStep2` suggests updating the student's password in the `students` table using a raw string input.
- **Risk**: If passwords are stored or handled in plaintext (not hashed), this exposes users to massive risk upon DB compromise.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- **ALWAYS hash** passwords before storing, using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- Enforce a password policy before accepting passwords.

---

## 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

### **Vulnerability: SQL Injection**
- The report mentions use of a connection pool for PostgreSQL, but does not specify if queries use **parameterized statements**.
- If SQL queries interpolate input directly, attackers may inject malicious SQL.
  
#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Use **parameterized queries** or query binding for all user input.
- Sanitize input to remove malicious content.

---

## 3. File Upload Handling

### **Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload**
- `updateStudentStep2` allows uploading of file paths for profile pictures and ID cards.
- If files are blindly saved and paths stored, attackers may try uploading executables or scripts (RCE risk), or overwrite existing files.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Restrict allowed file types (e.g., allow only JPEG/PNG for images).
- Store files outside webroot if possible.
- Generate unique file names, validate file contents and metadata.
- Limit file size and check for image content.

---

## 4. Authentication Handling

### **Vulnerability: Absent Authentication/Authorization Checks**
- No mention of authentication/authorization checks before updating sensitive data (password, ID card, etc.).
- Attackers may try updating other users’ data if endpoints do not enforce access controls.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Implement **authorization**: Only allow authorized users to update their own data.
- Add audit logging for sensitive changes.

---

## 5. Sensitive Data Exposure

### **Vulnerability: Insecure Data Returns**
- Both functions return the "full student record (all columns)”. If sensitive fields (like password hash, or scans of ID cards) are returned to the frontend, they may leak via the API.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Do not return sensitive fields to the client (never expose password hashes, raw file paths).
- Return only necessary info (e.g., user profile w/o security-related fields).

---

## 6. Lack of Data Validation

### **Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input**
- The documentation says validation will happen "separately".
- If validation is omitted, fields such as email, names, or dates may accept malformed or malicious data.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Enforce input validation **on all entry points**.
- Validate email format, date of birth, file uploads, and all other fields.

---

## 7. Error Handling

### **Vulnerability: Leaking Internal Errors**
- Documentation does not mention error handling. Returning raw DB errors may leak schema info or stack traces.

#### **Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Wrap DB calls and return generic error messages to the user; log full details server-side.
