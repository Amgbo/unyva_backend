# Code Review Report: `studentModel.ts`

## Overview

Based on your provided documentation, this is a **code/architecture review focused on industry standards, optimizations, and possible errors**. The actual implementation (`studentModel.ts`) is referenced, not shown, so feedback is inferred from your documentation.

---

## Issues & Suggested Corrections

### 1. **Password Handling (Security Risk)**

**Issue:**  
Storing passwords directly in the database is **insecure**. Passwords must be hashed with a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
// Before storing password:
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
// Use hashedPassword instead of raw password when updating DB
```

---

### 2. **SQL Injection Prevention**

**Issue:**  
If query parameters are interpolated directly (not shown in your code), this poses a major vulnerability.

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
// Use parameterized queries
const result = await pool.query(
  'UPDATE students SET password = $1 WHERE student_id = $2',
  [hashedPassword, student_id]
)
```

---

### 3. **Returning Sensitive Data**

**Issue:**  
Returning the full student record, including sensitive fields such as password hashes, after creation or update is unsafe. Clients should never receive the password hash.

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
// Exclude password from returned data
const sanitizedStudent = { ...studentRecord, password: undefined }
return sanitizedStudent
```

---

### 4. **Input Validation/Oversight**

**Issue:**  
No mention of validating uploaded image paths (e.g., verifying MIME type, size) or passwords (length, complexity).

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
if (!isValidFile(profile_picture)) throw new Error('Invalid image file.');
if (!isValidPassword(password)) throw new Error('Password does not meet policy.');
```
*(Assumes external validation functions are implemented.)*

---

### 5. **Database Transaction Consistency (Atomicity)**

**Issue:**  
If the two steps are interdependent (e.g., must succeed or rollback together for full registration), consider wrapping step updates in database transactions.

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
await pool.query('BEGIN');
// ... step 1 insert/update
// ... step 2 insert/update
await pool.query('COMMIT');
```

---

### 6. **Image Path Storage Oversight**

**Issue:**  
Storing file paths as strings without validation can lead to broken links and security risks (e.g., path traversal attacks).

**Corrected Pseudocode Suggestion:**

```typescript
// Validate file path strictly
if (!profile_picture.startsWith('/uploads/')) throw new Error('Invalid path.');
```

---

## Other Recommendations

- **TypeScript strictness**: Enable `strictNullChecks` for safer typings.
- **Documentation**: Specify error handling and edge cases in comments.
- **Sensitive audit logging**: Avoid logging raw credentials or file paths.

---

## Summary

**The following code lines should be added or altered:**

- Hash password before storing.
- Use parameterized SQL queries.
- Return sanitized objects (exclude password).
- Validate inputs (image paths, password).
- Enforce transactional consistency if needed.
- Strictly check file path formats.

These changes ensure core security, robustness, and code quality for your student registration model.
