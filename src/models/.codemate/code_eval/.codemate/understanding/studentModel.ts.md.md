# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This report evaluates two student management functions (`createStudentStep1` and `updateStudentStep2`), focusing on code quality, security, validation, and maintainability in the context of industry standards for backend development.

## Key Concepts and Practices

### 1. Error Handling
- **Current State:** No error handling is implemented around database queries.
- **Importance:** Ensures that unexpected database errors are managed gracefully and do not destabilize the API or back-end service.
- **Recommendation:** Wrap all database interactions (`pool.query`) with `try-catch` blocks to intercept and handle errors appropriately.

### 2. Security: Password Storage
- **Current State:** Passwords are stored in plain text.
- **Importance:** Storing plain text passwords is a severe security vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** Hash all passwords (e.g., using `bcrypt`) before storing them in the database.

### 3. Input/Data Validation
- **Current State:** No input validation is performed for incoming data such as emails, phone numbers, dates, or images.
- **Importance:** Prevents malformed, malicious, or inaccurate data from corrupting the database or creating security issues.
- **Recommendation:** Validate all user input before saving to the database, checking for correct formats and required fields.

### 4. Date Handling
- **Current State:** `date_of_birth` is managed as an untreated string.
- **Importance:** Ensures data consistency and integrity, especially for dates, which can vary in format.
- **Recommendation:** Normalize dates to a consistent format (preferably ISO) before saving.

### 5. SQL Injection & Safe Querying
- **Current State:** Uses parameterized queries, helping prevent SQL injection.
- **Importance:** Parameterized queries are crucial for database security.
- **Recommendation:** Continue using parameterized queries and ensure types/contents of inserted values are strictly validated.

### 6. Maintainability: Table/Column Name Management
- **Current State:** Table and column names are hardcoded in multiple places.
- **Importance:** Centralizing these strings enhances maintainability and reduces risk of typos or inconsistencies.
- **Recommendation:** Define table and column names as constants or enums.

### 7. Image Handling
- **Current State:** Unclear whether images are files, URLs, or raw data.
- **Importance:** Storing large binary data in the database is not optimal and can introduce performance and security issues.
- **Recommendation:** Store only image URLs or file paths; validate them before saving.

### 8. Module Export Style
- **Current State:** Module exports are used.
- **Importance:** Named exports enhance clarity and scalability in larger projects.
- **Recommendation:** Prefer named exports for all major functions.

### 9. Code Duplication
- **Current State:** Similar query-building logic is repeated.
- **Importance:** Duplicated code is harder to maintain and more error-prone.
- **Recommendation:** Refactor shared query patterns into utility functions to increase code reuse.

## Summary of Action Items

- Add robust error handling (`try-catch`) for all DB calls.
- Hash passwords before storage, using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- Implement comprehensive input/data validation for all user-supplied fields.
- Normalize and validate dates prior to saving.
- Validate that image fields are only URLs or file paths, not raw binary data.
- Extract and reuse common query or configuration constants.
- Use named exports to aid code clarity and maintainability.
- Refactor duplicated code into utility functions for consistency and ease of updates.
