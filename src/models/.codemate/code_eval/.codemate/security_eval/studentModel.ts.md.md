# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided code for **security vulnerabilities only**. Non-security or purely maintainability-related issues are excluded. The following points highlight security risks and mitigation strategies.

---

## 1. **Password Storage in Plain Text**

### **Vulnerability**
- User passwords are stored in plain text in the database.

### **Risk**
- If the database is compromised, attackers obtain actual passwords, risking user accounts and potentially accounts on other services (due to password reuse).

### **Mitigation**
- **Hash passwords** using a secure one-way function (e.g., bcrypt) **before storage**.
  ```typescript
  const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
  // Store hashedPassword instead of password
  ```

---

## 2. **Missing Data Validation (Input Sanitization)**

### **Vulnerability**
- No validation or sanitization of user inputs (email, phone number, date_of_birth, images).

### **Risk**
- Allows attackers to supply malformed or dangerous data, potentially leading to:
    - SQL Injection (if parameterization is misused in future changes)
    - Business logic flaws
    - Storage and retrieval problems

### **Mitigation**
- **Validate user input** before processing.
  ```typescript
  if (!isValidEmail(email)) throw new Error('Invalid email address');
  if (!isValidPhone(phone)) throw new Error('Invalid phone number');
  ```

---

## 3. **Image Field Handling (Path vs. Blob)**

### **Vulnerability**
- Unclear whether `profile_picture` and `id_card` store file paths, URLs, or raw binary data.

### **Risk**
- **Directly storing binary or unchecked data** could allow file upload vulnerabilities, path traversal, or storage of dangerous executables.
- If paths are handled improperly, may lead to information disclosure, local file reads, or overwrites.

### **Mitigation**
- **Store only validated URLs or server-managed file paths. Never accept raw user input for file system access.**
  ```typescript
  if (!isValidImagePath(profile_picture)) throw new Error('Invalid image path');
  ```

---

## 4. **Lack of Error Handling and Exposure of Raw Errors**

### **Vulnerability**
- DB operations are unwrapped in `try-catch` and can lead to unhandled promise rejections.

### **Risk**
- Unhandled errors may expose sensitive environment or database info in stack traces or error responses to clients.
- API instability increases likelihood of denial of service.

### **Mitigation**
- **Catch errors and handle gracefully, avoid leaking internal details.**
  ```typescript
  try {
    // DB operation
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error internally
    throw new Error('Database operation failed'); // Generic message
  }
  ```

---

## 5. **SQL Injection Protection**

### **Vulnerability**
- Currently **parameterized queries are used** (`pool.query(query, values)`), which is secure. However, **lack of explicit input type checks** is noted.

### **Risk**
- If code is refactored or inputs are used directly, risk of SQL injection increases.

### **Mitigation**
- **Continue using parameterized queries**.
- **Validate all user inputs** to expected types.
- **Never concatenate user input into SQL statements.**

---

## 6. **Date Field Validation**

### **Vulnerability**
- `date_of_birth` is accepted as a string, which could allow malformed input, or even malicious payloads if used elsewhere.

### **Risk**
- Could be used to bypass logic, produce incorrect application states, or hide attacker activity.

### **Mitigation**
- **Normalize and validate all dates** using standard (e.g., ISO 8601) formats.
  ```typescript
  const isoDate = new Date(date_of_birth).toISOString().slice(0, 10);
  ```

## **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                      | Impact                                  | Mitigation                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Plain-text password storage         | Account theft; password leaks           | Hash passwords (bcrypt)          |
| Missing input validation            | Injection, logic flaws, bad data        | Validate/sanitize all inputs     |
| Unchecked image/file paths          | File upload, path traversal, exec files | Validate image path formats      |
| Lack of error handling              | Info leak, instability                  | Graceful, generic error handling |
| SQL injection possibility           | Data theft, DB takeover                 | Parameterized queries, input validation |
| Date field as string                | Bypass logic, error states              | Normalize & validate dates       |

---

## **Key Recommendations**

- **Hash passwords before storage** (`bcrypt` or similar).
- **Validate every piece of user input** before using it in queries or saving to DB.
- **Never trust file paths or raw file data from user input.** Validate and use managed storage.
- **Catch database errors and avoid exposing raw error messages** to users.
- **Maintain parameterized query usage**. Never fall back to string concatenation.

## **Final Note**

**Failure to implement these fixes places your system at significant risk of data breach, account compromise, denial of service, and other security incidents. Immediate remediation is strongly recommended.**
