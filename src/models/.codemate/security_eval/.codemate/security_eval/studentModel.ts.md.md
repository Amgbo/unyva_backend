# Security Vulnerability Report

**Code Reviewed:** `src/models/studentModel.ts`  
**Focus:** Identification of security vulnerabilities only

---

## 1. Password Storage

**Issue:**  
Passwords are set directly via `SET password = $1,` without evidence of hashing.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Plaintext password storage:** Storing passwords without hashing exposes all credentials if the database is breached.

**Recommendation:**  
- Hash passwords with a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storage.

---

## 2. SQL Injection

**Observation:**  
Queries use parameterized syntax: `$1, $2, ...` with `pool.query(query, values)`.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **No vulnerability detected:** Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection in this code segment.

---

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure (File Fields)

**Fields Potentially At Risk:**  
- `profile_picture`
- `id_card`

**Issue:**  
No file validation or access controls are shown in the code.

**Vulnerability:**  
- Attackers may upload malicious files or access files they shouldn't.
- Exposure of sensitive documents.

**Recommendation:**  
- Validate file types and sizes on upload.
- Enforce access controls so only authorized users can retrieve files.

---

## 4. Error Handling (Information Disclosure)

**Issue:**  
Absence of explicit error handling.

**Vulnerability:**  
- Unhandled errors may propagate stack traces or database details to users, aiding attackers.

**Recommendation:**  
- Gracefully handle and sanitize errors before sending responses to the client.

---

## 5. Input Validation

**Issue:**  
No input validation on fields such as email, phone, or dates.

**Vulnerability:**  
- Unvalidated inputs may lead to XSS, logic manipulation, or database inconsistency.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always validate and sanitize all user inputs.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability             | Severity   | Recommendation                                   |
|-------------------------- |------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Plaintext Passwords       | **Critical**   | Hash and salt passwords before storage            |
| File Upload/Access        | **Medium**     | Validate uploads, enforce strict access controls  |
| Error Handling Disclosure | **Medium**     | Sanitize and handle all errors gracefully         |
| Input Validation Missing  | **Medium**     | Validate and sanitize every external field        |
| SQL Injection             | Safe           | Already protected by parameterized queries        |

---

## Final Recommendations

- **Use strong password hashing** for all credential storage.
- **Validate and sanitize all inputs** before database operations.
- **Apply strict file upload controls** and access restrictions.
- **Implement comprehensive error handling** to prevent leakage of technical details.
- **Periodically audit code** for security best practices and update dependencies.
