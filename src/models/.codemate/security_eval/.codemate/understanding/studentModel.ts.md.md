# High-Level Documentation for `src/models/studentModel.ts`

## Overview

The `studentModel.ts` file manages student data interactions with the database. It includes functions for inserting, updating, and retrieving student records, handling fields such as credentials and profile-related data.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Student Information Management:**  
  Handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student entities, including personal information (name, email, phone), credentials (password), and document/file references (profile pictures, ID cards).

- **Database Operations:**  
  Utilizes SQL queries via a connection pool for safe, efficient database interactions and updates.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Management:**  
  *Passwords must be hashed (not stored in plaintext) before being saved to the database.*

- **SQL Injection Prevention:**  
  Uses parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) to prevent SQL injection attacks.

- **Sensitive File and Data Handling:**
  - Fields such as `profile_picture` and `id_card` may reference files requiring access control.
  - Should enforce both frontend and backend validation for file uploads.

- **Input Validation:**  
  All user input (including emails, phone numbers, dates, and uploaded file information) needs thorough validation and sanitization before database usage.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Errors from database operations should be caught and sanitized before being sent to the client to prevent leakage of technical details.

## Best Practices

- **Passwords:** Use a robust hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before persisting.
- **Files:** Sanitize filenames, restrict file types, validate file size, and implement per-user access controls.
- **Input:** Apply both format checks (regex, type) and basic sanitization to all fields.
- **Database Queries:** Maintain parameterized queries to ensure safety.
- **Errors:** Implement comprehensive error handling, logging server-side details only internally.

## Intended Usage

This module should be used as the foundational layer for all student-related data manipulations, supporting secure authentication, profile management, and document verification within the application. It is not intended for direct client exposure; always use approved controller or service layers to mediate requests.

**Note:**  
Regular security reviews and keeping dependencies up-to-date are essential to maintain the integrity and safety of student data managed by this model.
