# Security Vulnerability Analysis

Below is a security-focused vulnerability report based solely on the provided code review content:

---

## 1. **Directory Traversal via Filename Injection**
**Risk:** High  
The code uses `file.originalname` directly when saving uploaded files. This enables attackers to craft a filename like `../../malicious.js`, resulting in arbitrary file write outside the intended directory (directory traversal), potentially overwriting server code or sensitive files.

**Mitigation:**  
Always sanitize or restrict filenames to a safe pattern, e.g.:
```javascript
const sanitizedFilename = file.originalname.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_');
cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + sanitizedFilename);
```

---

## 2. **Arbitrary File Overwrite**
**Risk:** High  
Lack of filename uniqueness and sanitization allows for the risk that two users uploading a file with the same name will overwrite each other's data. If an attacker knows or guesses existing filenames, they can overwrite legitimate files.

**Mitigation:**  
Use a random or time-based prefix/suffix to ensure filenames are unique.

---

## 3. **Unrestricted File Upload (Dangerous File Types)**
**Risk:** High  
The code does not restrict file types. Attackers can upload executable scripts, web shells, or other malicious files, which can then be run on the server if the upload directory is web-accessible.

**Mitigation:**  
Implement a file type filter by checking MIME types and/or file signatures:
```javascript
fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only image uploads are allowed.'));
  }
}
```

---

## 4. **Denial of Service via Large File Upload**
**Risk:** Medium  
No file size limits are set. Attackers can upload very large files, exhausting disk space or memory, resulting in a DoS attack.

**Mitigation:**  
Enforce strict size limits:
```javascript
limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // e.g., 5MB max
```

---

## 5. **Insecure Directory Handling**
**Risk:** Medium  
Although not directly a vulnerability, if the upload directory does not exist and the code does not create it securely, misconfigurations may cause files to be written elsewhere or fail in unpredictable ways. Directory permissions should also be considered to prevent unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:**  
Check/create the upload directory (`fs.mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })`) with proper access permissions.

---

## 6. **Poor Error Handling**
**Risk:** Low/Medium  
Omitting error handling in async callbacks (e.g., in `filename`) may result in unhandled promise rejections or application crashes, which could be leveraged for DoS.

**Mitigation:**  
Wrap logic in try/catch blocks and properly handle errors in callbacks.

## Priority Remediation Checklist

1. **Sanitize uploaded filenames to prevent directory traversal and overwrites.**
2. **Restrict file types by MIME type (and ideally also by file signature/magic number).**
3. **Implement strict file size limits.**
4. **Ensure upload directory exists, is outside public web root, and is properly permissioned.**
5. **Use robust error handling everywhere.**

**Implement these mitigations to eliminate high-impact vulnerabilities and ensure secure file uploads.**
