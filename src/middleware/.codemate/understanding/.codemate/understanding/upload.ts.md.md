### High-Level Documentation

#### Purpose
This code sets up and exports a reusable middleware for handling file uploads in a Node.js/Express application, utilizing the `multer` library.

#### Core Functionality

- **Imports:**
  - Utilizes `multer` to manage multipart/form-data for uploads.
  - Employs Node.js `path` module for reliable file path manipulation.

- **Storage Configuration:**
  - Configures `multer` to use disk storage:
    - **Directory**: All uploaded files are saved in the `uploads/` folder.
    - **Naming Convention**: Uploaded files are stored with names prefixed by the current timestamp to avoid name collisions, followed by the original filename.

- **Exported Middleware:**
  - The module exports an `upload` middleware, ready for integration with Express routes to process and store incoming files.

#### Application Scenario
Incorporate the `upload` middleware into your Express routes to facilitate server-side file storage. It automatically manages storage location and file renaming, making file handling seamless and secure.

#### Example Usage
```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { upload } from './path-to-this-file';

const app = express();

app.post('/upload', upload.single('fileFieldName'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File successfully uploaded!');
});
```

This allows you to easily process and store uploaded files from client requests in an organized and consistent manner.
