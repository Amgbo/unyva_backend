High-Level Documentation:

**Purpose:**
This code configures and exports middleware for handling file uploads in a Node.js application, using the `multer` library.

**Key Features:**
- **File Storage Location:** Uploaded files are saved to a local directory called `uploads/`.
- **Unique Filenames:** Each uploaded file is renamed by prepending the current timestamp (via `Date.now()`) to its original filename, helping avoid naming collisions.
- **Exported Middleware:** The configured upload middleware is exported as `upload` for integration into Express routes where file uploads are required.

**Intended Usage:**
Integrate the `upload` middleware into request handlers to easily process multipart/form-data requests and save files to the server.
