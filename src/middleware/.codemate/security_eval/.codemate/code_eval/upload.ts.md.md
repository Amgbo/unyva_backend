# Security Vulnerability Review Report

Below are targeted recommendations based on the code analyzed, including **pseudo-code snippets** to correct each critical vulnerability and industry best practices.

---

## 1. Add File Type Validation

**Replace/Add:**

```js
const allowedMimeTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
  }
};
```

**Usage:**

```js
export const upload = multer({ 
  storage, 
  fileFilter: fileFilter 
});
```

---

## 2. Set File Size Limitation

**Replace/Add:**

```js
export const upload = multer({ 
  storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5 MB limit (adjust as needed)
});
```

---

## 3. Sanitize or Randomize File Names

**Replace/Add inside `filename`:**

```js
import crypto from 'crypto';
filename: (_, file, cb) => {
  // Use random filename, preserve extension only:
  const ext = path.extname(file.originalname);
  const randomName = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
  cb(null, `${randomName}${ext}`);
}
```

---

## 4. Secure/Validate Upload Directory

**Before Multer Setup:**

```js
import fs from 'fs';

// Ensure uploads directory exists and has safe permissions:
if (!fs.existsSync('uploads')) {
  fs.mkdirSync('uploads', { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 });
}
```

**Server-side configuration:**  
Configure server to prevent public access to `uploads/`, e.g., using `.htaccess`, nginx rules, or equivalent.

---

## 5. Authenticate & Authorize File Uploads

**Usage Example in Route (pseudo-code):**

```js
// Assume authMiddleware ensures authenticated/authorized access
app.post('/upload', authMiddleware, upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```

---

## 6. Integrate Malware/Virus Scanning (Optional but recommended in production)

**Add after upload (pseudo-code):**

```js
import antivirus from 'antivirus-lib'; // example placeholder

// After saving file, scan before taking further action
const scanResult = await antivirus.scanFile(req.file.path);
if (!scanResult.clean) {
  // delete the uploaded file and return error
  fs.unlinkSync(req.file.path);
  return res.status(400).send('Malware detected in file');
}
```

---

## Summary

**Applying all above recommendations is essential to meet industry standards for secure, robust, and scalable file upload implementations.**

**Neglecting these may result in:**
- System compromise
- Data loss/leakage
- Application downtime
- Regulatory/fiduciary repercussions

---

### **Action Items**

- Add file type filter and size limits
- Sanitize/randomize file names
- Ensure and secure the upload directory
- Require authentication/authorization for uploads
- Consider integrating malware scanning on uploads
