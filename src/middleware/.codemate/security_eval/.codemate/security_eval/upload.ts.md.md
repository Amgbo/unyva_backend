# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Under Analysis

```javascript
import multer from 'multer';
import path from 'path';

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: 'uploads/',
  filename: (_, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
  },
});

export const upload = multer({ storage });
```

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **Unrestricted File Types (Missing File Filter)**
**Issue:**  
No validation is performed on the type of file being uploaded.  
**Impact:**  
Attackers can upload dangerous files (e.g., executables, scripts), possibly enabling remote code execution, malware deployment, or web shells.  
**Remediation:**  
Implement the `fileFilter` option in Multer to allow only safe file types (e.g., images, PDFs).

---

### 2. **No Upload Size Limit**
**Issue:**  
The code does not limit the size of uploaded files.  
**Impact:**  
Potential Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading excessively large files, using up disk space or memory.  
**Remediation:**  
Set the `limits` option in Multer to restrict file size (e.g., `limits: { fileSize: 1048576 }` for 1MB).

---

### 3. **Unsafe Use of User-Provided Filename**
**Issue:**  
`file.originalname` is used directly in the saved filename.  
**Impact:**  
- **Path Traversal:** Malicious file names like `../../evil.js` could attempt to escape the intended directory.  
- **Overwriting Files:** Common names could overwrite existing files.  
- **XSS:** Malicious filenames displayed in UI without encoding could trigger attacks.  
**Remediation:**  
Sanitize the filename (strip/replace unsafe characters); ideally, generate a random name or use a UUID and restrict the extension.

---

### 4. **Unprotected Upload Directory**
**Issue:**  
Files are saved to `'uploads/'`, which might be publicly accessible on the web server.  
**Impact:**  
- Direct access/serving of uploaded files, including dangerous types  
- Potential execution of malicious scripts  
**Remediation:**  
Keep `uploads/` outside the public directory, or restrict access (e.g., web server rules, permissions).

---

### 5. **Missing Authentication/Authorization**
**Issue:**  
The code exposes upload functionality without any access controls.  
**Impact:**  
Anyone (including anonymous attackers) can upload arbitrary files.  
**Remediation:**  
Apply authentication and/or authorization checks to restrict uploads to trusted users.

---

### 6. **No Malware/Content Scanning**
**Issue:**  
There is no scanning of uploaded files for malware or viruses.  
**Impact:**  
Uploaded files may contain malware, threatening users or compromising servers.  
**Remediation:**  
Integrate file scanning (e.g., with ClamAV, commercial solutions) after uploads.

|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| No type filtering                  | RCE, malware, webshells         | Use `fileFilter` in Multer         |
| No file size limit                 | DoS, resource exhaustion        | Use `limits` in Multer             |
| Unsafe filename usage              | Path traversal, overwrite, XSS  | Sanitize/generate safe filename    |
| Unprotected uploads directory      | File serving/execution by web   | Secure directory, restrict access  |
| Missing authentication/authorization| Unrestricted uploads           | Use access controls                |
| No malware scanning                | Virus/malware risk              | Scan files post-upload             |

## Remediation Recommendations

- **File Type Filtering:** Use Multer's `fileFilter` to restrict allowed file types and extensions.
- **File Size Limiting:** Set the `limits` option to restrict the maximum allowed size.
- **Filename Sanitization:** Donâ€™t use user-provided filenames directly; sanitize or replace with a random/UUID-based name.
- **Protect the Upload Directory:** Ensure uploads are stored in a safe, non-public directory with restricted server privileges.
- **Access Control:** Restrict upload endpoints to authenticated/authorized users.
- **Malware Scanning:** Integrate malware/virus scanners for uploaded files, especially in production.

> **Unmitigated upload vulnerabilities can easily lead to server compromise, data loss, and abuse by attackers. All of the above issues should be addressed before deploying to production.**
