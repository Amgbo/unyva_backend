# Security Vulnerability Report: Registration Schemas

## Overview

This report reviews potential **security vulnerabilities** in the provided registration schema code for a university student registration process using [Zod](https://zod.dev/). The code covers validation logic for both personal/contact information and account security in a two-step process.

---

## 1. Password Validation Weakness

**Issue:**  
The password and confirm password fields only require a **minimum of 6 characters**. There are no checks for password strength (e.g., inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols).

**Impact:**  
Allows weak passwords that are easier to brute force, increasing risk of unauthorized account access.

**Recommendation:**
- Enforce a stronger password policy, e.g.:
  - Minimum 8 characters.
  - At least one uppercase letter.
  - At least one lowercase letter.
  - At least one digit.
  - At least one special character.
- Use regex validation for password strength.

---

## 2. Lack of "Confirm Password" Equality Check

**Issue:**  
There is **no validation** to ensure that `password` and `confirm_password` are identical.

**Impact:**  
Users can submit mismatched passwords, increasing risk of failed logins and confusion. Attackers may exploit mismatches to attempt to guess passwords or capture users in a registration loop.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add cross-field validation to confirm that `password === confirm_password`.

---

## 3. No Enforcement of Unique User Data

**Issue:**  
The schema does **not enforce uniqueness** for user fields such as `student_id`, `email`, or `phone`.

**Impact:**  
Users may register multiple accounts with the same identifiers, possibly leading to impersonation, account takeover, or confusion.

**Recommendation:**  
- On the server side, enforce uniqueness checks before account creation.
- Deny registration if the email, student ID, or phone number is already in use.

---

## 4. Email Restriction Limited to Suffix

**Issue:**  
Email validation only checks that the domain ends with `@st.ug.edu.gh`. There are **no additional checks** for known disposable email services or subdomain abuse.

**Impact:**  
Attackers could register accounts with potentially invalid or disposable university emails if they control such addresses, leading to spam or fraud.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use internal systems to verify university-issued emails (e.g., check against a directory of valid student accounts).
- Optionally, verify email delivery (e.g., via email confirmation).

---

## 5. No Protection Against Injection Attacks

**Issue:**  
The schemas **do not sanitize input data**: fields such as name, address, and student ID allow arbitrary strings.

**Impact:**  
Attackers could inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) if the data is not sanitized before storage, display, or processing.

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize all input fields before storing or processing data.
- Use proper escaping when displaying user input in web pages or using in queries.

---

## 6. Insufficient Phone Number Validation

**Issue:**  
Phones are only checked for being a string of at least 10 digits.

**Impact:**  
Non-digit characters or malformed phone numbers could be accepted, leading to issues with SMS delivery or user account recovery.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use regex validation to ensure valid phone number format (e.g., digits only, appropriate country code).
- Optionally, verify phone number ownership via SMS.

---

## 7. No Anti-Enumeration Protections

**Issue:**  
There is no mention of rate limiting or anti-enumeration features.

**Impact:**  
Automated attackers could attempt mass registrations, brute force student IDs or emails, or harvest valid accounts.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement rate limiting on registration endpoints.
- Use CAPTCHA to prevent automated form submissions.

---

## 8. No Mention of Secure Transmission

**Issue:**  
No explicit instruction to use secure connections (HTTPS) for registration.

**Impact:**  
Sensitive data (password, personal info) could be intercepted if sent over insecure channels.

**Recommendation:**  
- Require all registration and login traffic to use HTTPS.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability             | Severity | Remediation                           |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Weak Password Validation | High     | Enforce strong password policy        |
| No 'Confirm Password' Check | Medium  | Add equality validation               |
| Lack of Unique Checks    | High     | Enforce uniqueness on server          |
| Weak Email Validation    | Medium   | Integrate directory/email verification|
| No Input Sanitization    | High     | Sanitize/escape all user input        |
| Poor Phone Validation    | Medium   | Use strict phone regex and verification|
| No Anti-Enumeration      | Medium   | Add rate limiting/CAPTCHA             |
| Insecure Transmission    | High     | Use HTTPS for all traffic             |

## Conclusion

While the schemas use Zod for basic field validation, **critical security controls are missing**.  
- Password strength and confirmation,
- Input sanitization,
- Uniqueness enforcement,
- Rate limiting,
- Secure transmission,  
are all essential to prevent account compromise, fraud, injection attacks, or information disclosure.

**Implement the recommendations above to ensure robust registration security.**
