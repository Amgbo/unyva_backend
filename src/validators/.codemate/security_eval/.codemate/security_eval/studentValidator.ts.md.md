# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided TypeScript/Zod validation code for user registration. The focus is on identification of security vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.

---

## 1. **Password Security**

- **Issue:** Only a minimum length of 6 characters is enforced for the password and confirmPassword fields.
- **Risks:** Easily crackable passwords, exposure to brute-force attacks, lack of complexity requirements, no checks against common/breached passwords.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Enforce a minimum length of 8â€“12 characters.
    - Require mixed-case, digits, and symbols.
    - Integrate checks against breached password lists or APIs.

---

## 2. **Email Validation**

- **Issue:** Email validated by a simple string endsWith check against '@st.ug.edu.gh'.
- **Risks:** Bypass via whitespace, case, or unicode normalization. Inadequate format validation.
- **Recommendation:**
    - Use robust email format validation.
    - Normalize (toLowerCase, trim) before domain checks.
    - Sanitize email input.

---

## 3. **Input Length and Format Checking**

- **Issue:** Fields like first_name, last_name, student_id, address, etc. only checked for non-empty strings.
- **Risks:** Potential resource exhaustion/DoS if excessively long input is accepted; injection possibilities with unrestricted characters.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Set reasonable maximum lengths (e.g., `.max(50)`).
    - Use regex to enforce valid character sets.

---

## 4. **Student ID Validation**

- **Issue:** Only non-empty string enforced.
- **Risks:** ID spoofing, injection, format bypass.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Enforce specific student ID format via regex.
    - Check for uniqueness at storage.

---

## 5. **Gender Enumeration**

- **Issue:** Only specific values allowed; no immediate vulnerability.
- **Risks:** Possible logic errors if not handled safely downstream.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure all values are securely handled in business logic.

---

## 6. **Phone Number Validation**

- **Issue:** Only minimum length of 10 enforced.
- **Risks:** Allows non-numeric, overly long, or malformed input.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Use regex for valid phone numbers.
    - Set maximum length (e.g., 15).

---

## 7. **Date of Birth Validation**

- **Issue:** Only non-empty string enforced.
- **Risks:** Accepts invalid/malicious input, possible logic errors.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Parse and verify date format (e.g., ISO8601).
    - Restrict to reasonable date ranges; disallow future dates.

---

## 8. **Confirm Password Comparison**

- **Issue:** No check that password matches confirmPassword.
- **Risks:** Potential user confusion, possible password handling bugs.
- **Recommendation:** 
    - Add a refinement to ensure `password === confirmPassword`.

---

## 9. **Input Sanitization**

- **Issue:** No input sanitization evident.
- **Risks:** SQL injection, XSS, log/file injection, other code injection attacks.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Sanitize all inputs before using in queries, rendering to HTML, logging, etc.

---

## 10. **Validation Location**

- **Issue:** No indication that validation/sanitization is performed server-side.
- **Risks:** Client-side validation can be bypassed; server must always re-validate and sanitize.
- **Recommendation:**  
    - Enforce all validation and sanitization on the server.

## Summary Table

| Field            | Security Risk                                   | Recommendation                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Password         | Weak, no complexity, length too low             | Enforce longer, complex       |
| Email            | Poor domain check, no normalization/sanitization| Normalize, robust format      |
| All text fields  | No max lengths or format checks                 | Set max, use regex            |
| Student ID       | No format/uniqueness check                      | Regex, uniqueness             |
| Phone            | Inadequate format and length validation         | Regex, max length             |
| DOB              | Accepts arbitrary string                        | Parse & validate date         |
| confirmPassword  | Mismatch not detected                           | Enforce match                 |
| Sanitization     | Inputs not sanitized                            | Always sanitize               |
| Validation locale| No server-side guarantee                        | Always validate at server     |

---

## Remediation Action Items

1. Add max length and character limits to all string fields.
2. Strengthen password requirements and add password/confirmPassword match check.
3. Normalize, validate, and sanitize emails properly.
4. Use regex for all formatted fields (student ID, phone, date).
5. Sanitize and validate on the server side to defend against client bypass and injection.
