# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The code defines a **user registration input validation schema** using the [zod](https://zod.dev/) library in TypeScript. It specifies the expected structure and rules for user-supplied data during the sign-up process for a university system.

## Validated Fields and Logic

- **First Name & Last Name:**  
  Must be non-empty strings.

- **Student ID:**  
  Must be a non-empty string.

- **Email:**  
  Must be a string ending with `@st.ug.edu.gh`.

- **Gender:**  
  Must be one of a predefined set of three values (using `z.enum`).

- **Password & Confirm Password:**  
  Must each be at least 6 characters long (no other checks).

- **Phone Number:**  
  Must be at least 10 characters (no format checks).

- **Address:**  
  Must be a non-empty string.

- **Date of Birth:**  
  Must be a non-empty string (no date validation).

## Security Considerations

- **Password Policy:**  
  The minimum 6 character length is enforced, but there are no complexity, max length, or match checks.

- **Email:**  
  A simple domain string check is performed, without normalization or robust email format validation.

- **Length & Format:**  
  Nearly all text fields only check for non-empty input, with no maximum lengths or character restrictions.

- **Sanitization & Validation:**  
  Inputs are not sanitized or normalized, and no server/client validation context is specified.

- **Field-specific Risks:**  
  - **student_id**: No format enforcement.
  - **phone**: No digit or format enforcement.
  - **dob**: No date format or range enforced.
  - **confirmPassword**: No check that it matches `password`.

## Recommended Practices (per the report)

- Enforce stronger password and confirm/match rules.
- Restrict input lengths and allowed characters for all fields.
- Normalize and strictly validate emails.
- Use regular expressions for field formatting (IDs, phone, date).
- Ensure all validation and sanitization occurs *server-side*.

## Common Usage

The schema would typically be used as:
```typescript
const userInput = { ... }; // data from client
const parsed = UserRegistrationSchema.parse(userInput); // throws if input invalid
```
or
```typescript
const result = UserRegistrationSchema.safeParse(userInput); // returns result object
```

## Limitations

- Only minimal validation is currently enforced.
- Intended as an initial (not comprehensive) defense against invalid input.
- Must not be solely relied upon for application security â€” further server-side and business logic validation is required.

---

**In summary:**  
The code provides a basic registration data shape with simple non-empty and enum checks, but lacks robust validation, normalization, and sanitization necessary for production-level security. Additional comprehensive checks should be added to mitigate security risks.
