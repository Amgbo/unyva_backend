## Overview

This code provides input validation schemas for a user registration process using the Zod library in TypeScript. It enforces rules on form inputs to ensure data integrity and improve security and usability.

---

## Components

1. **Schema Definitions**  
   - Uses Zod (`z.object`) to define validation rules for register form steps (e.g., `registerStep1Schema`, `registerStep2Schema`).
   - Input types are inferred from these schemas for TypeScript safety.

2. **Validation Rules**
   - **Password Validation:** Passwords must meet complexity requirements (minimum length, etc.).
   - **Password Confirmation:** Ensures the "password" and "confirmPassword" fields match before accepting the input.
   - **Date of Birth:** Validates date input as either a correctly formatted string (YYYY-MM-DD) or as a JavaScript Date object.
   - **Phone Number:** Ensures the phone field contains only digits and meets a minimum length requirement.
   - **Email Domain:** Enforces that student emails end with a specific university domain (e.g., `@st.ug.edu.gh`).

3. **Error Feedback**
   - Custom error messages are defined for each validation rule for better user guidance.
   - Error message consistency is reviewed for user experience and maintainability.

4. **Maintainability & Configuration**
   - Encourages use of constants for values subject to change (such as allowed email domains).
   - Error messages and validation logic are kept descriptive and uniform for easier updates.

## Best Practices Illustrated

- **Security:** Prevents mismatched passwords and enforces password complexity.
- **Data Quality:** Validates formats for dates, email, and phone numbers.
- **User Experience:** Provides clear, actionable error messages for input issues.
- **Maintainability:** Separation of schema logic and configuration.

## Usage Context

Intended for form validation in web applications—typically during user registration—ensuring front-end or back-end (API) only receives well-structured, secure input.

---

## Summary

This validation code improves reliability and user experience in registration flows by:
- Enforcing strict, customizable rules on user input.
- Preventing common form errors (e.g., mismatched passwords, invalid formats).
- Providing maintainable, consistent error messaging and configurations.
