# Security Vulnerability Report

---

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided code for **security vulnerabilities only**. Below are the main security concerns discovered in the code related to input validation, authentication, and data integrity, as well as recommended remediation steps.

---

## Vulnerabilities & Recommendations

### 1. **Password Confirmation Mismatch**

**Vulnerability:**  
- The `registerStep2Schema` includes fields `password` and `confirmPassword`. However, there is **no validation** to ensure that `confirmPassword` matches `password`.
- **Risk:** Attackers or users could submit mismatched passwords, leading to confusing signup states and potential security flaws in downstream logic.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add a `.refine()` check to the schema so that the two fields must be identical.

```typescript
registerStep2Schema = z.object({
  password: z.string().min(6, { message: 'Password must be at least 6 characters long' }),
  confirmPassword: z.string().min(6, { message: 'Confirm Password must be at least 6 characters long' }),
}).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords do not match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"],
});
```

### 2. **Date of Birth Format and Injection Risks**

**Vulnerability:**  
- The schema accepts `date_of_birth` as a freeform string with only length validation (`min(1)`).
- **Risk:** Accepting arbitrary strings could allow injection of malicious payloads (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) if the downstream code directly uses the input, or may accept invalid dates leading to authorization or logic errors.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use regex validation to accept only the expected date format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`), or a type-safe `Date` object.
- Always sanitize and validate date fields before processing.

```typescript
date_of_birth: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/, { message: 'Date of birth must be YYYY-MM-DD format' })
```

---

### 3. **Phone Number Integrity**

**Vulnerability:**  
- The `phone` field is only validated for minimum length (`min(10)`), allowing values with non-numeric characters.
- **Risk:** This could permit entry of inputs like `1234567<script>`, which could be abused in systems that use phone numbers for identification or messaging (e.g., user lookup, SMS, etc.).

**Recommendation:**  
- Add a regex check to ensure phone numbers are strictly numeric and of valid length.

```typescript
phone: z.string().regex(/^\d{10,}$/, { message: 'Phone number must contain only digits and be at least 10 digits' })
```

---

### 4. **Email Domain Enforcement**

**Observation:**  
- The current code correctly restricts email registration to an allowed domain using `.endsWith("@st.ug.edu.gh")`, preventing unauthorized signups.
- **Recommendation:** No vulnerability found here, but for **defense in depth**, avoid hardcoding and ensure strict string comparison (case sensitivity and trailing spaces).

---

### 5. **General Input Validation**

**Vulnerability:**  
- Several fields use `.min(1)` checks, but do not validate expected patterns or unacceptable characters (e.g., names, addresses).
- **Risk:** Unvalidated string inputs could be vectors for injection attacks (XSS, SQL injection) if not properly sanitized downstream.

**Recommendation:**  
- Apply stricter regex validations where possible, and always sanitize values before storing or displaying.

## Summary Table

| Area              | Vulnerability           | Remediation                           |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Passwords         | No match validation    | Use `.refine()` for equality check    |
| Date of Birth     | Freeform string input  | Add regex or use typed date object    |
| Phone Number      | No digit enforcement   | Add regex for numeric-only input      |
| Email Domain      | Observed/No issue      | Keep validation; avoid hardcoding     |
| Other Inputs      | Weak/string checks     | Use stricter patterns, sanitize input |

---

## Final Recommendations

- **ALWAYS validate** user input strictly on both client and server.
- Use **schema validation** to prevent dangerous payloads and enforce expected formats.
- Synchronize frontend and backend validation logic to prevent bypasses.
- If data is used for authentication, messaging, or identification, be even stricter and log invalid attempts.
- Review downstream usage of all inputs for additional sanitization and encoding.

**Implementing the above will mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and greatly enhance the security posture of the codebase.**
