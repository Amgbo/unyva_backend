# Security Vulnerabilities Report

**Analyzed File:** `src/index.ts`  
**Date:** 2024-06  
**Scope:** This report reviews only the provided code for security vulnerabilities (not other referenced files/modules).

---

## 1. CORS Policy: Default Permissiveness

**Code:**
```ts
app.use(cors());
```

**Issue:**
The use of `cors()` without any configuration enables CORS for all origins (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`). This permits unrestricted cross-origin requests, exposing the API to potential abuse and data exfiltration, especially if sensitive data or authentication is involved.

**Recommendation:**
Restrict allowed origins explicitly in production. Example:
```ts
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['https://your-frontend-domain.com'],
  credentials: true,
}));
```
Never use open CORS in production for APIs handling sensitive data.

## 2. Static File Serving: Potential Path Traversal

**Code:**
```ts
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../uploads')));
```

**Issue:**
While Express’s `express.static` resolves paths internally and is generally secure against basic path traversal attempts, **exposing an uploads directory directly** can leak sensitive files (e.g., server config files, generated report files, backups) if controls on file uploads or directory contents aren’t enforced.

**Recommendation:**
- Validate and sanitize file uploads to prohibit uploading sensitive files or untrusted file types.
- Store sensitive files outside public directories.
- Optionally, serve files via an authenticated route, not with `express.static`.

## 3. Environment Variable Usage

**Code:**
```ts
const PORT = Number(process.env.PORT) || 5000;
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
```

**Issue:**
Listening on `0.0.0.0` exposes the server on all network interfaces, increasing attack surface. While this is sometimes necessary (e.g., in Docker), it is riskier than binding to `localhost` or a private interface.

**Recommendation:**
- Use `localhost` or a restricted host in non-Docker/local environments, where possible.
- Ensure that firewall rules and reverse proxies are in place if exposing publicly.

---

## 4. Lack of Rate Limiting

**Issue:**
No rate limiting middleware (like [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)) is in place. This exposes your endpoints to brute force, scraping, or DoS attacks.

**Recommendation:**
- Add rate limiting middleware to throttle requests per IP.

---

## 5. Error Logging Leak

**Code:**
```ts
catch (err) {
  console.error('Database connection error:', err);
}
```
**Issue:**
If `err` contains sensitive data (such as credentials in stack traces), logging it to console can increase the risk if logs are accessible externally or over unsecured channels.

**Recommendation:**
Sanitize error output, and never log secrets in production. Prefer structured logging with care for operational security.

---

## 6. No Helmet for HTTP Header Security

**Issue:**
The app does not use [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) or similar middleware to set security-oriented HTTP headers, such as `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.

**Recommendation:**
Add Helmet middleware:
```ts
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());
```

---

## 7. No Input Validation on User Inputs

**Issue:**
The server accepts JSON and URL-encoded data (`express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`), but there is no mention of sanitizing inputs on endpoints. This can lead to security issues such as injection attacks (SQL, XSS), even if the code isn’t visible in this file.

**Recommendation:**
- Validate and sanitize all user input on all endpoints, especially database-related routes.

> **Note:** This report is limited to the code shown. Other files (e.g., routes, DB code) should be reviewed for SQL injection, authentication/authorization, file upload, and XSS vulnerabilities.

---

**Remediation priority:**  
- **HIGH:** CORS, input validation, uploaded file handling  
- **MEDIUM:** Rate limiting, host restriction, security headers  
- **LOW:** Error logs sanitization
