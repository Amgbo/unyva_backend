# Security Vulnerability Report

**Scope:** The following report highlights only security vulnerabilities found in the submitted code.

---

## 1. Insecure CORS Configuration

**Code:**
```typescript
app.use(cors());
```
**Description:**  
Using `cors()` with no options enables all origins (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).  
**Risk:**  
- API is accessible from any domain, exposing sensitive endpoints.
- Can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or information leakage if cookies or credentials are allowed.
**Mitigation:**  
Configure CORS with a specific allow-list in production:
```typescript
app.use(cors({ origin: ['https://yourdomain.com'] }));
```

---

## 2. Unprotected Static File Serving

**Code:**
```typescript
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../uploads')));
```
**Description:**  
Serves files directly from the uploads directory with no authentication or authorization.
**Risk:**  
- Anyone can access potentially sensitive files.
- Possible information disclosure.
- (If uploads are not sanitized elsewhere: risk of directory traversal.)
**Mitigation:**  
Serve uploaded files only after authentication/authorization checks using a custom route.  
Ensure all file paths are sanitized.

---

## 3. No HTTP Security Headers

**Description:**  
No middleware sets HTTP headers to help protect the server (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
**Risk:**  
- Vulnerable to clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and related attacks.
**Mitigation:**  
Add [helmet](https://npmjs.com/package/helmet):
```typescript
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());
```

---

## 4. Default Host Allows Public Access

**Code:**
```typescript
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
```
**Description:**  
Default binds the server on all interfaces.
**Risk:**  
- Server is publicly accessible, possibly leaking internal APIs.
**Mitigation:**  
Default to `localhost` in development. In production, restrict access using host/network controls.

---

## 5. Potential Error Information Disclosure

**Code:**
```typescript
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Database connection error:', err);
}
```
**Description:**  
Server logs database errors to the console. (Check if such errors ever leak to client responses in other code.)
**Risk:**  
- Attackers could learn infrastructure details if error messages reach clients.
**Mitigation:**  
Never send raw error messages to clients. Log full details only server-side.

# Summary Table

| Vulnerability                | Risk      | Remediation                             |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Insecure CORS                | High      | Restrict allowed origins                |
| Unprotected File Serve       | High      | Add authentication/authorization        |
| Missing Security Headers     | Medium    | Use helmet, secure headers              |
| Public Server Binding        | Medium    | Use localhost or firewall/proxy         |
| Error Info Disclosure        | Medium    | Never expose raw errors to clients      |

# Final Recommendations

- Address CORS and static file exposure immediately.
- Enable security headers.
- Review error handling throughout the application.
- Limit server network exposure in development.

**Note:** This report only covers security vulnerabilities explicit in the given code. Further review of route handlers and related files is advised.
