# High-Level Documentation for `src/db.ts`

## Overview

This code sets up a PostgreSQL database connection pool for use within the application. It initializes the pool with user, password, host, port, and database parameters, defaulting to specific values if environment variables are not set. Additionally, it includes error event handling for database connection issues.

---

## Primary Responsibilities

- **Database Configuration**:  
  Reads connection parameters from environment variables. If variables are missing, defaults to hardcoded values:
  - `DB_USER` → defaults to `'postgres'`
  - `DB_PASSWORD` → defaults to `'Siderpsk123$'`
  - `DB_NAME` → defaults to `'unyva_db'`
  - `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT` are similarly handled.

- **Connection Pool Initialization**:  
  Creates a PostgreSQL connection pool instance using the provided (or default) configuration.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Listens for connection errors from the pool and logs them to the console.

- **Exporting**:  
  Exports the pool for use by other parts of the application.

## Key Features and Behaviors

- **Environment-First Configuration**:  
  Prioritizes values from environment variables to support flexible deployment.

- **Fallback Defaults**:  
  Uses hardcoded credential and configuration defaults if environment variables are not set.

- **Verbose Error Logging**:  
  Logs all database connection errors and stack traces during runtime.

---

## Usage

Other modules can import the initialized connection pool for querying the PostgreSQL database.

---

## Design and Security Considerations

- The pool should be used for efficient database connections and resource management.
- Credentials and error messages should be managed securely, avoiding exposure of sensitive data.
- The implementation is intended for direct use rather than user interaction.

---

## Extensibility

- Can be modified to integrate with secure secret management systems.
- Logging behavior can be adapted for different environments (e.g., production vs. development).

**Note**  
Hardcoded credentials and verbose logging present potential security risks and must be addressed as outlined in vulnerability remediation recommendations.
