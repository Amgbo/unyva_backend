# High-Level Documentation of `src/index.ts`

This file serves as the main entry point for initializing and starting an Express-based Node.js backend application. Below is a high-level overview of its responsibilities and core structure:

### Purpose
- **Bootstraps the web server for Unyva’s backend service**
- **Loads environment configurations and external dependencies**
- **Applies global middleware**
- **Configures and registers all main app routes**
- **Performs initial database connectivity check**
- **Serves static assets (e.g., uploads)**
- **Handles startup and runtime errors**

---

## Main Responsibilities

### 1. **Environment & Dependencies**
- Loads environment variables using `dotenv`
- Imports essential dependencies: `express`, `cors`, route modules, and path tools
- Handles modern ES Module syntax and directory path resolution for portability

### 2. **Middleware Setup**
- Registers CORS for cross-origin support
- Parses JSON in incoming requests
- Applies additional middlewares as needed

### 3. **Routing**
- Imports and mounts modular route handlers (students, etc.)
- Defines sanity check or health endpoint (`/`)
- Ensures route import naming and extensions are correct per ES modules

### 4. **Static File Serving**
- Serves files from configurable “uploads” directory
- Validates existence of uploads directory
- Uses robust path resolution relative to the main file

### 5. **Database Connectivity**
- On startup, asynchronously checks PostgreSQL (or other DB) connection
- Logs successful connection, avoids exposing sensitive details
- Catches and logs errors with type safety (TypeScript best practices)

### 6. **Configuration Validation**
- Checks presence and validity of essential environment variables (`PORT`, `HOST`)
- Warns or sets defaults if variables are missing

### 7. **Server Startup and Error Handling**
- Starts Express server on configured host/port 
- Logs accessible URLs
- Handles possible server start errors (port conflict, permissions) with informative logging
- Globally listens for unhandled Promise rejections to ensure process stability

### 8. **ESM Compatibility**
- Employs ESM patterns for directory resolution (`import.meta.url`, etc.)
- Notes/documentation encourage validating compatibility across deployment environments

---

## Global Error and Stability Features

- Redundant error handling for both synchronous and asynchronous failures
- Structured logging for all startup and runtime issues
- Ensures clean process exit on critical failures

---

## Overall Design Notes

- Emphasizes modularity for scalability
- STRONGLY focuses on security and robustness through configuration and error checking
- TypeScript is used with recommendation for strict typing
- Prioritizes production-readiness by validating file existence, configuration, and handling edge cases

---

## **For Developers & Maintainers**

- Always verify route import casing and file extensions for ES Module compatibility
- Review and maintain strong configuration validation for environment parameters
- Adhere to robust error handling and logging practices to ease debugging and improve reliability
- Test ESM directory and path handling in all targeted environments

---

**Summary:**  
`src/index.ts` is designed as a modern, best-practice Express server bootstrap file: loading config, setting up middleware and routes, verifying the critical DB connection, serving static assets, and handling errors and configuration issues to maximize security and stability.
