# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Scope

This report **ONLY** covers **security vulnerabilities** found in the provided PostgreSQL pool configuration code.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**
- **Description:** Default values for database user and password are present in the code. Hardcoding sensitive credentials is a critical security vulnerability as it could expose secrets if the codebase is leaked or shared.
- **Recommendation:** Remove all default values for sensitive fields. Rely exclusively on environment variables for such secrets.

    ```js
    user: process.env.DB_USER,    // Do not use "user: process.env.DB_USER || 'defaultuser'"
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,  // Do not use "password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'defaultpass'"
    ```

---

### 2. **Missing Validation for Required Environment Variables**
- **Description:** If environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) are missing, the pool could try to connect using empty strings or undefined values, potentially connecting to unintended databases or failing insecurely.
- **Recommendation:** Perform strict validation of required environment variables at startup and fail fast if any are missing.

    ```js
    if (!process.env.DB_HOST || !process.env.DB_USER || !process.env.DB_PASSWORD || !process.env.DB_NAME) {
        throw new Error("Missing required database environment variables.");
    }
    ```

---

### 3. **Unrestricted Production Logging**
- **Description:** Logging sensitive connection information in production environments can inadvertently expose credentials or configuration data to unsecured logs, especially when using `console.log`.
- **Recommendation:** Use a robust logging system and ensure sensitive information is **never** logged, especially in production. Condition logging on environment (e.g., only log connection events in development).

---

### 4. **Improper Parsing of Database Port**
- **Description:** Fallback logic like `Number(process.env.DB_PORT) || 5432` is insecure since a user could specify a port of `0` (which is valid but would fallback to 5432), potentially causing accidental connections elsewhere.
- **Recommendation:** Always validate the port input and fail or set it only if it's a valid integer.

    ```js
    const dbPort = parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT, 10);
    port: Number.isNaN(dbPort) ? 5432 : dbPort,
    ```

---

### 5. **Pool Configuration Defaults**
- **Description:** Not explicitly setting `max` clients, idle timeouts, and connection timeouts can expose your application to resource exhaustion attacks or degraded performance under load, resulting in potential denial-of-service.
- **Recommendation:** Always set sane and reviewed pool configuration parameters, preferably through secure environment variables.

    ```js
    max: parseInt(process.env.DB_POOL_MAX, 10) || 20,
    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
    ```

## Summary Table (Security Only)

| Vulnerability                      | Severity  | Recommendation         |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials               | Critical  | Remove defaults, use env ONLY |
| Missing required env validation     | Critical  | Validate & fail fast   |
| Unrestricted production logging     | High      | Restrict/secure logging|
| Improper port parsing               | Medium    | Robust parsing/validation|
| Pool config defaults missing        | Medium    | Always set pool limits |

## Conclusion

To address the security vulnerabilities in the code:

- **Remove all hardcoded credentials.**
- **Validate all required environment variables at startup.**
- **Do not log sensitive information in production.**
- **Validate input values (esp. ports).**
- **Set restrictive, tested pool settings for connections.**

**Implementing these corrections is essential for maintaining strong security posture in your PostgreSQL-backed Node.js applications.**
