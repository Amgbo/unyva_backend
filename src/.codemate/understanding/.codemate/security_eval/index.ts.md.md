# Security Vulnerabilities Report for `src/index.ts`

This security analysis focuses exclusively on the vulnerabilities and security concerns present in the described code block for `src/index.ts`, the main entry point of an Express + PostgreSQL TypeScript backend.

---

## 1. **Environment Variables & Configuration**

### Vulnerability
- **Sensitive Data Exposure via .env**: Loading sensitive data (such as database credentials, API secrets) from a `.env` file is standard, but if the `.env` file is accidentally committed to source control or the server is misconfigured, secrets could be leaked.

### Recommendations
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` and ensure it is not published or exposed.
- Use secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) for production.

---

## 2. **CORS Configuration**

### Vulnerability
- **Open CORS Policy**: Simply enabling CORS (`app.use(cors())`) without restrictions accepts requests from any origin by default, which may allow cross-origin credential leaks or exposure of APIs intended to be private.

### Recommendations
- Restrict CORS to trusted origins with:  
  ```js
  app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://yourdomain.com' }));
  ```
- Avoid using open CORS policies in production.

---

## 3. **Body Parsers**

### Vulnerability
- **Denial of Service (DoS) – Large Payloads**: Using JSON and URL-encoded body parsers without size limits allows attackers to POST excessive data, potentially causing memory exhaustion.

### Recommendations
- Set reasonable payload size limits:
  ```js
  app.use(express.json({ limit: '1mb' }));
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ limit: '1mb', extended: false }))
  ```

---

## 4. **Static File Serving (`uploads` directory)**

### Vulnerability
- **Unrestricted Static File Exposure**: Serving an entire `uploads` directory allows any file in that directory (including potentially sensitive files) to be downloaded if it exists.

- **Path Traversal Risk**: If not properly sanitized, attackers could use crafted URLs to access files outside intended directories (less of a risk with Express’ `express.static`, but caution is warranted).

### Recommendations
- Limit file types and ensure uploaded files are sanitized and validated.
- Use access controls or authentication for static file routes if needed.
- Do not store sensitive files in `uploads`.

---

## 5. **Database Connectivity**

### Vulnerability
- **No Mention of Query Parameterization**: While connectivity is checked with a safe query (`SELECT NOW()`), it isn’t clear if API routes use parameterized queries/ORM; lack thereof exposes application to **SQL Injection**.

### Recommendations
- Use parameterized queries or a trusted ORM everywhere; review all API route handlers for secure database access.

---

## 6. **API Routing**

### Vulnerability
- **No Authentication/Authorization**: The high-level overview does not mention any authentication or authorization on API endpoints (`/api/students`, `/api/home`, `/api/test`). This makes all endpoints accessible to anyone, including potentially sensitive data manipulation routes.

### Recommendations
- Implement authentication middleware.
- Enforce authorization checks based on user roles and endpoint sensitivity.

---

## 7. **Error Handling and Information Disclosure**

### Vulnerability
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Logging full database error objects on failed connections or API errors can accidentally leak sensitive details (e.g., database structure, credentials, paths).

### Recommendations
- Log generic errors in production; avoid sending internal error details to clients.

---

## 8. **Logging Sensitive URLs**

### Vulnerability
- **URL Logging**: Logging full startup URLs (including host and port) is usually harmless, but if URLs contain query strings or authentication info, these can be accidentally exposed.

### Recommendations
- Avoid logging sensitive information; review log contents for secrets.

---

## 9. **Use of ES Modules and Modern Syntax**

### Vulnerability
- No direct issues here, but ensure that dependencies and build tools are up to date to avoid supply chain vulnerabilities.

---

## 10. **Rate Limiting / Abuse Protection**

### Vulnerability
- **No Rate Limiting**: The application does not employ rate limiting, allowing brute-force, scraping, or DoS attacks.

### Recommendations
- Implement rate limiters via middleware (`express-rate-limit`).

# **Immediate Action Items**
- Restrict CORS origins.
- Add authentication and authorization to all API endpoints.
- Limit request body payloads.
- Harden static file serving; avoid exposing sensitive files.
- Validate and sanitize all input, including query parameters.
- Implement rate limiting.
- Review error handling/logging practices.
- Ensure `.env` security.

**Review all external route handlers (`studentRoutes`, `homeRoutes`) for further vulnerabilities!**
