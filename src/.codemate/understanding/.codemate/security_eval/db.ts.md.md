# Security Vulnerability Report  
## Target: `src/db.ts` â€“ PostgreSQL Connection Pool Module

---

> _This report focuses strictly on security vulnerabilities within the provided code description and inferred design. Code is described but not directly shown, so analysis is based on the documented logic and best practices with such modules._

---

## 1. **Sensitive Information Handling**

**Positive:**
- Credentials (host, port, user, password, database) are loaded from environment variables, not hard-coded, which is best practice.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Accidental Logging:**  
  If connection errors are logged without sanitizing messages, sensitive connection details (such as full connection strings or errors that include passwords) could be output to console or log files.  
  **_Mitigation:_**  
  - Ensure error logs do not include raw connection faults or credential details.
  - Avoid logging full `process.env` objects or objects containing secrets.

---

## 2. **Database Connection Configuration**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Weak Defaults:**  
  - If "sensible defaults" for credentials are weak (e.g., `'postgres'`/`'postgres'`), instances run in development/production could be exposed to brute force or unauthorized access.
  - Some environments fall back to insecure defaults if `.env` is missing.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Validate that defaults do not allow public or weak access.
  - Force required variables or fail to start the app if missing.
- **Lack of SSL:**  
  - No mention of enforcing SSL/TLS for PostgreSQL connections. Without `ssl: true`, communications could be intercepted ('man-in-the-middle').
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Add a configuration option (and default) for enabling SSL, especially for remote/datacenter access.
  - Validate certificates if possible.

---

## 3. **Loading Environment Variables**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **dotenv in Production:**  
  - `.env` files present in production images or repos can leak secrets if mishandled.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Load from secure environment, not files, in production.
  - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` and do not commit default `.env` files with live credentials.

---

## 4. **Error Handling**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Error Surface / Leaking Details:**  
  - Logging or propagating raw database errors may reveal internal schema details, database names, or hints useful for attackers.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Sanitize outgoing errors. Show generic error messages to clients.

---

## 5. **Database Pool Access**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted Use:**  
  - If the exported `pool` is available throughout the application, access should be internally controlled.
  - No auditing or limiting of query frequency, which may allow denial-of-service by exhausting pool connections.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Apply rate limiting and access controls at the API level.

---

## 6. **Injection Prevention**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Query Safety Beyond Pool Scope:**  
  - Although not shown in this file, using a raw pool allows both parameterized (`pool.query('SELECT ...', [params])`) and string interpolation (unsafe!) queries.  
  - If downstream code interpolates user input into queries, risk of SQL injection.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Enforce and document parameterized query use only.

---

## 7. **Upgrade and Patch Concerns**

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Outdated Dependencies:**  
  - Use of old versions of `pg` or `dotenv`, which may have known CVEs.
  **_Mitigation:_**
  - Keep dependencies updated and audit frequently.

# **Recommendations**

1. **Sanitize all database error logs** and avoid logging secrets.
2. **Enforce secure, non-default environment variables** for all credentials.
3. **Support SSL/TLS** for database connections.
4. **Never commit `.env` or default-credential files** to source control.
5. **Sanitize errors exposed to callers** (e.g., APIs).
6. **Audit downstream query usage** for parameterization; forbid string-based query interpolation.
7. **Regularly update and audit dependencies** (e.g., `pg`, `dotenv`).
8. **Monitor usage/noise on the pool**; implement query/connection limits as needed.

**NOTE:** This is an analysis based on architectural documentation, not source code. Review actual implementation for further vulnerabilities (e.g., improper pool shutdown, privilege escalation, or mishandled promise chains).
