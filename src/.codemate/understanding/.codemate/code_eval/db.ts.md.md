# Code Review Report

File: `src/db.ts`

## 1. **Industry Standards & Best Practices**

**Assessment:**  
The code adheres to the main principles of centralized connection management and secure use of environment variables. The use of event handlers to log connection status and errors is positive.  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Error Logging:** Ensure errors are not just logged but can be escalated or monitored (e.g., use a logging library or notify monitoring services).
- **Environment Variables Validation:** It's best practice to validate environment variables at startup.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**  
```pseudo
if (!process.env.DB_HOST || !process.env.DB_USER || !process.env.DB_PASSWORD || !process.env.DB_NAME) {
  throw new Error("Database environment variables are not properly set.");
}
```

## 2. **Unoptimized Implementations**

**Assessment:**  
- The connection pool should have configurable parameters (min/max connections, idle timeout, etc.), rather than relying on library defaults.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**  
```pseudo
pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '',
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'postgres',
  max: process.env.DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS || 10,       // Add this for better scalability
  idleTimeoutMillis: process.env.DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT || 30000 // Optional for resource management
});
```

---

## 3. **Potential Errors**

**Assessment:**  
- If the `.env` file is missing or loading fails, `dotenv` should notify the application.
- Event handlers (such as for error events) should not simply log but might also trigger alerting.

**Suggested Pseudocode:**  
```pseudo
const result = dotenv.config()
if (result.error) {
  throw result.error // Instead of silent failure, escalate the error
}
```

```pseudo
pool.on('error', (err) => {
  // Log error, but also notify/apply recovery if in production
  alertAdmin(err)  // pseudo-function for notification
});
```

---

## 4. **Other Observations**

- **Unused Imports:** Confirm that only necessary packages are imported.
- **Async/Await Support:** Consider exposing an async `connect` helper for future extensibility.
- **Connection Leaks:** Ensure connections are released properly in all parts of the codebase.

---

## **Summary**

The code is fundamentally sound and applies basic best practices for centralizing database connections in a Node.js application.  
However, for improved resilience, scalability, and industry standard compliance:

- Validate environment variables at startup.
- Use configurable pool parameters.
- Handle dotenv failures explicitly.
- Ensure error/event handling goes beyond logging if necessary.

With these changes, the module will be robust, production-ready, and compliant with most enterprise software development standards.
