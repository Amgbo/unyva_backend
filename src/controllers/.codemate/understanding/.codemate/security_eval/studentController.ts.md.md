# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Scope

This report analyzes potential security vulnerabilities in the **Student Registration & Authentication Module** as described in the provided documentation. The analysis is strictly based on the design and implied code practices mentioned—actual implementation details (e.g., whether parameterized queries are used) are **not visible** and thus some issues are discussed as risks or assumptions.

---

## 1. Password Handling

**Positive aspects:**
- Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt` before storage, which is a secure approach.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Password Strength:** No explicit mention that passwords are checked for complexity or strength. Weak passwords may be accepted unless enforced in validation.
- **Password Storage Security:** Assumes `bcrypt` is configured with a sufficient cost factor; a low cost factor could speed up brute-force attacks.
- **Timing Attacks:** The documentation does not specify constant-time comparison for passwords (but `bcrypt.compare` should be used).

---

## 2. Email Verification Token

**Positive aspects:**
- Tokens for email verification are generated using `crypto`, a secure library.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Token Expiration:** No mention of expiry for verification tokens. Tokens should expire after a reasonable period to mitigate risks of token leakage.
- **Token Leakage/Prediction:** Assuming `crypto.randomBytes` is used securely, tokens are unpredictable; otherwise, attackers may hijack accounts.
- **Insufficient Token Scope:** The verification token is presumably sent via email and is likely validated via a GET request, which could leak it via browser history, referrers, or proxies. Prefer POST requests or short-lived tokens.

---

## 3. User Authentication & Session Security

**Positive aspects:**
- Uses JWT for session/authentication management.
- JWT secret is loaded from environment variables.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **JWT Secret Management:** No mention of required strength or rotation of JWT secrets. Weak or reused secrets can be guessed or leaked.
- **JWT Algorithm:** Not specified whether only strong algorithms (`HS256` or asymmetric with algorithm whitelisting) are accepted.
- **JWT Expiry:** No mention of expiry time for JWT tokens. Long-lived tokens increase risk if compromised.
- **Token Revocation:** No mention of mechanism to revoke JWTs (for logout or stolen token scenarios).
- **Refresh Logic:** Absent mention of refresh tokens or session expiration strategy.

---

## 4. Input Validation

**Positive aspects:**
- Extensive input validation mentioned (`zod` used for schemas).

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incomplete Validation:** "Comprehensive" is subjective. If `zod` schemas are not properly configured, inputs could bypass validation, leading to injection or data corruption.
- **Sanitization:** No explicit mention of sanitizing inputs to prevent XSS when displaying user data in front-end (applies for returned profile info, file names, etc.).

---

## 5. File Uploads

- **File Upload Handling:** Profile pictures and ID cards are uploaded; URLs are stored.
- **Handling Location:** "Assumed handled elsewhere," which poses multiple risks:
    - **Malware Uploads:** If files are not validated for type, size, and content, malicious files (e.g., executable code, scripts) could be uploaded and accessed/executed.
    - **Path Traversal:** If file paths are constructed using user input, attackers could exploit directory traversal bugs.
    - **Public Access:** URLs are stored, but there is no mention that uploaded files are secured or access-controlled (e.g., student #1 should not see files for student #2).
    - **Overwriting Files:** No mention of how naming conflicts are handled.
    - **Content-Type Validation:** Unspecified.

---

## 6. Database Security

- **SQL Injection Risk:** The documentation does not specify use of parameterized queries or ORM. If raw queries are used without parameterization, vulnerable to SQL injection, especially as student IDs and emails are user-supplied.
- **Error Reporting:** Standardized error messages are mentioned, but care must be taken not to leak sensitive details (e.g., stack traces, SQL errors).

---

## 7. Email Security

- **Email Verification Bypass:** There is a feature to "temporarily disable for testing." This should not be possible in production without explicit and secure access control—otherwise, attackers could register without email verification.
- **Sensitive Info Exposure:** Be cautious not to include sensitive data or secrets in email content sent to users.

---

## 8. Information Disclosure

- **Profile Access Control:** The `getStudentProfileById` endpoint allows fetching any student profile. If not strictly authorized (e.g., for admin only), this could leak personal data to unauthorized users.
- **JWT Claims:** If JWTs include sensitive info (e.g., password hashes, tokens) in claims, an attacker who obtains the JWT could read them. Keep JWT payloads minimal and non-sensitive.

---

## 9. Environment Variables & Secrets

- **Exposure Risk:** Proper steps must be taken to ensure `.env` files or environment variable secrets are **not** exposed or committed to source control.
- **Permissions:** Environment variables for mail and JWTs must be readable only by the application, with restricted OS permissions.

---

## 10. Miscellaneous

- **Rate Limiting:** No mention of rate limiting on endpoints. Registration, login, and verification endpoints should be rate-limited to prevent brute-force or automated abuse.
- **Brute Force Protections:** No mention of account lockout or throttling after repeated failed login or verification attempts.
- **CSRF Protection:** For endpoints that change state (especially uploads), CSRF protection should be enabled, particularly if cookies are used for JWT or session.
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** All routes, especially login and registration, should require HTTPS to prevent credential leakage.

## Conclusion

While the module shows strong security intentions (use of `bcrypt`, `crypto`, JWT, input validation), the documentation leaves room for **multiple critical security vulnerabilities**—especially in file handling, authorization, token management, and input validation.

**It is strongly recommended to perform a full code review (including actual query and middleware logic) prior to production deployment** and to patch all identified risks above.
