# High-Level Documentation

This codebase provides API endpoints for student registration, authentication, profile management, and email verification. It demonstrates a layered approach to handling user data, security, file uploads, and database interactions. Key technical and security best practices are highlighted, along with recommendations for production-readiness.

## Functionality Overview

- **User Registration**: Handles new student sign-up, including validation, password hashing, profile image and ID upload.
- **Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for session management, bcrypt for password protection, and enforces verified email checks before login.
- **Profile Access**: Authenticated endpoints return user-specific data. Type safety is enforced for request objects.
- **Email Verification**: Issues one-time tokens for email verification with planned expiry and input validation.
- **Database Operations**: Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and backs user creation with unique constraints for consistency.

## Technical Highlights

- **Validation**: Zod schemas validate incoming data; recommendations extend to file and query param validation.
- **Security**:
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt and configurable salt rounds.
  - JWT sessions keyed via environment variables (no hardcoded secrets).
  - File uploads checked for safe MIME types and filenames.
  - Query param and token verification (format, length).
- **Error Handling and Logging**:
  - try/catch blocks provide robust error management.
  - Shift advised from console.log to structured logging for sensitive operations.
- **Database Access**:
  - SQL queries parameterized; SELECT statements limited to necessary columns for efficiency and privacy.
  - Unique constraints and error handling prevent race conditions on registration.
- **Type Safety**:
  - Extensions to request types ensure reliable user identification in handlers.

## Security and Industry Standard Recommendations

- Remove or mask debug logs involving sensitive data.
- Require secure configuration via environment variables, preventing weak defaults.
- Enforce password strength policies and rate-limit registration/login endpoints.
- Robustly validate file uploads and sanitize paths/filenames.
- Ensure the email verification token has a clear expiry and cannot be reused or enumerated.
- Tighten input validation, especially for query parameters and tokens.

## Production Checklist

- [ ] All debug logging replaced with proper logging (no sensitive data in logs)
- [ ] No hardcoded JWT or crypto secrets in source code
- [ ] Email verification mandatory before login
- [ ] Uploaded files validated and sanitized
- [ ] Password policies and environment-driven salt rounds enforced
- [ ] SQL queries only fetch required columns, never `SELECT *`
- [ ] Registration handles and logs duplicate entry errors gracefully
- [ ] Strict type safety for all request handlers
- [ ] Query parameters strictly validated
