# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This report analyzes the provided code for **security vulnerabilities only**. Each vulnerability is described with analysis and recommendations.

---

## 1. Hardcoded JWT Secret Fallback

```js
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production';
```
**Severity:** High

- If the environment variable is missing, the code uses a hardcoded JWT secret, which risks all issued tokens being easily predictable and not unique to the deployment.

**Recommendation:**  
- Do NOT use hardcoded secrets in production environments.
- Fail application startup if `JWT_SECRET` is missing.
- Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret management systems.

---

## 2. Sensitive Data Exposure in Logging

```js
console.log('üîê Login attempt for student_id:', student_id);
// ... other logs including student objects/status
console.log('üîë Using JWT secret:', jwtSecret ? 'Set' : 'Not set');
```
**Severity:** Medium

- Logging user identifiers, status flags, and potentially secrets can expose sensitive information in logs, which may be accessible to attackers or unauthorized users.

**Recommendation:**  
- Redact or avoid logging PII, secrets, or flags that could assist an attacker.
- Use logging libraries supporting log levels and redaction.
- Review production logging practices for compliance and privacy.

## 3. Insecure Email Verification Tokens

```js
const verificationToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
const verifyLink = `${process.env.BASE_URL}/api/students/verify-email?token=${verificationToken}`;
```
**Severity:** Medium

- Although token generation is secure, there is no mechanism to **expire or invalidate** unused tokens, making them usable indefinitely if leaked.

**Recommendation:**  
- Store an expiry timestamp with the token and reject expired tokens.
- Periodically clean up unused tokens.
- Consider logging and alerting on usage of expired tokens.

---

## 4. Lack of Rate Limiting / Brute Force Protection

**Severity:** High

- There is **no rate limiting** or account lock-out logic for login (or registration) endpoints, making brute-force attacks feasible.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use rate-limiting middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).
- Add account lock-out or progressive delay after successive failed logins.
- Consider CAPTCHA for critical flows.

---

## 5. Weak Password Handling

**Severity:** Medium

- The code does not enforce password strength/complexity, increasing risk of credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.

**Recommendation:**  
- Enforce password complexity rules (length, character classes).
- Use a password strength estimation library or regex validation.
- Inform users of password requirements.

---

## 6. Unverified User Authentication

```js
// commented out verification check
// if (!student.is_verified) {...}
```
**Severity:** High

- If left disabled in production, unverified accounts can log in, bypassing email verification defenses.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure verification is required in production.
- Use environment flags or configuration to differentiate development/test from production logic.
- Audit authentication logic regularly.

---

## 7. File Upload Security

```js
profile_picture_url = `/uploads/${profilePicFile.filename}`
id_card_url = `/uploads/${idCardFile.filename}`
```
**Severity:** Medium

- No evidence of file type validation, anti-malware scanning, or secure storage.
- Publicly accessible uploads could host malicious files.

**Recommendation:**  
- Restrict uploaded file types and validate extensions/content-type.
- Store files outside the web root.
- Scan files for malware.
- Use random file names to prevent enumeration and collisions.

---

## 8. Possible Secret Exposure via .env

```js
user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
```
**Severity:** Low

- If `.env` files or environment variables are leaked (e.g., via version control), email credentials could be compromised.

**Recommendation:**  
- Never commit `.env` files.
- Use dedicated secret management where possible.
- Audit repository history for accidental secret inclusion.

---

## 9. XSS/CSRF Risk in Uploaded Content

**Severity:** Medium

- No mitigation for XSS or CSRF from user-uploaded content (images, etc.).
- If uploads are served directly, malicious content could trigger an attack.

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize or validate all uploaded content before serving.
- Use security headers (`helmet`, etc.).
- Store and serve files using a separate domain or media service.

---

## 10. Enumeration via API Responses

**Severity:** Medium

- Error messages like "Student not found," "Invalid student ID," or "Student already exists" allow attackers to enumerate registered accounts.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use generic authentication error messages ("Invalid credentials").
- Avoid confirming the existence of accounts except in flows with rate limits and anti-enumeration logic (e.g., password reset).

---

## 11. Missing HTTPS Enforcement

**Severity:** Medium

- Verification links and API endpoints may be non-HTTPS if the deployment does not enforce HTTPS.

**Recommendation:**  
- Force HTTPS on all URLs.
- Use `Strict-Transport-Security` headers.
- Ensure all communication‚Äîespecially authentication and verification links‚Äîis encrypted.

## Critical Remediations

- Disallow hardcoded secrets and enforce JWT secret presence.
- Reinstate verification check for login.
- Add rate limiting, account lockout, and password complexity checks.
- Secure file uploads with validation and storage.
- Audit logs for sensitive data exposure.
- Ensure all endpoints and links use HTTPS.
- Use generic error messages for all authentication-related responses.

**Further recommendations:**  
After addressing the above, conduct regular code and infrastructure security reviews, deploy automated scanning tools, and monitor for suspicious activity.
