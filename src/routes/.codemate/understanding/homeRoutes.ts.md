# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code defines an Express.js route handler module that serves as an API endpoint for retrieving homepage data for an application. The endpoint aggregates several datasets—banners, categories, and products—and returns them in a single JSON response. Access to the data is protected by authentication middleware.

## Features

- **Route and Middleware:**  
  - The main route (`GET /`) requires users to be authenticated via a JWT token, enforced by the `verifyToken` middleware.
  
- **Data Aggregation:**  
  - Returns three collections as mock data:
    - **Banners:** Promotional images and titles for the homepage.
    - **Categories:** Item categories with associated icons.
    - **Products:** Sample products with names, prices, and images.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implements try/catch to handle unexpected server errors and responds with a 500 status.

## Usage

- **Endpoint:** `GET /`
- **Access Control:** Requires a valid JWT token.
- **Response Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "banners": [ ... ],
    "categories": [ ... ],
    "products": [ ... ]
  }
  ```

## Extensibility

- Mock data placeholders should be replaced with actual database queries in production.
- Designed to be imported and used in an Express application.

## Summary

This module provides a protected API endpoint for retrieving homepage data, currently using mock data but structured for easy integration with a database in the future.
