# High-Level Documentation

## Overview
This code implements an Express router for a protected API endpoint designed to deliver mock "storefront" data such as banners, product categories, and featured products. The endpoint utilizes authentication middleware to restrict access, serving as a scaffold for development or initial dashboard loading in client applications.

## Key Features

- **Authentication Protection**  
  The endpoint is secured with the `verifyToken` middleware, ensuring that only authenticated users can access its resources.

- **GET Endpoint**  
  Responds to GET requests at the root path (`/`) of the router, providing a pre-structured data set intended for use in a storefront or marketplace interface.

- **Returned Data Structure**  
  On success, returns a JSON object containing:
  - `banners`: Array of promotional banner objects with image URLs and titles.
  - `categories`: Array of product category objects, each with an icon and name.
  - `products`: Array of product objects, each with a name, price, and image URL.

- **Error Management**  
  Catches and logs internal errors, responding with a status code 500 and a relevant error message if an exception occurs during request handling.

## Typical Use Case

This endpoint is best suited for providing the initial data payload needed to render a homepage or dashboard for client applications (web, mobile, etc.), ensuring fast delivery of promotional and featured content. The sample data should be replaced with live database queries in production environments.

## Integration & Usage

- Mount this router within your main Express application.
- All incoming requests to this route must supply a valid token that passes the authentication middleware.
- Intended for use as an initial landing page data source.

## Extensibility

- Swap out static/mock arrays for dynamic database queries to provide real, up-to-date content.
- Expand the data structure to include more information or features as business needs grow.
- Enhance error handling and logging for improved robustness in production.

## Important Notes

- Ensure rigorous testing of authentication flows and error handling mechanisms before production use.
- Review and refactor the data sources to connect to real backend systems as required.
