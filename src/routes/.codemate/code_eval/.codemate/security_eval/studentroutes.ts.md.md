# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## File: `src/routes/studentroutes.ts`

---

## 1. File Upload Handling (`multer`)

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Unrestricted file types**: Without a file filter, attackers can upload malicious file types (e.g., executables, scripts) that may lead to code execution or information disclosure if handled insecurely downstream.
- **Unlimited file size**: No size restriction on uploads enables denial-of-service (DoS) via large file uploads, exhausting disk or memory resources.
- **Hardcoded path**: Using a static upload directory (`uploads/`) may leak filesystem structure or allow directory traversal attacks if not properly sanitized.

**Remediation:**  
- Implement a `fileFilter` to only accept safe file types (e.g., images).
- Set `limits.fileSize` to restrict upload size.
- Sanitize and centralize config (use environment variables).

**Example:**
```typescript
const upload = multer({
  dest: process.env.UPLOAD_PATH || 'uploads/',
  limits: { fileSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024 }, // 2MB
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    const allowed = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];
    if (allowed.includes(file.mimetype)) cb(null, true);
    else cb(new Error('Invalid file type'));
  }
});
```

## 2. Profile Access Without Proper Authorization

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Both `/profile` and `/profile/:studentId` endpoints use `authMiddleware`, but there are no checks ensuring that the student accessing `/profile/:studentId` matches the logged-in user or possesses sufficient privileges. An attacker could enumerate IDs to access othersâ€™ profiles.

**Remediation:**  
- Enforce authorization checks in the controller to ensure the requesting user matches the `studentId` or is an admin.

**Example:**
```typescript
function getStudentProfileById(req, res) {
    if (req.user.id !== req.params.studentId && !req.user.isAdmin) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
    }
    // Fetch and return profile...
}
```

## 3. Missing Error Handling for File Uploads

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Unhandled errors**: Invalid file uploads (type/size) may throw errors that are not caught, leading to vague client responses or even process crashes, which can be exploited for DoS.

**Remediation:**  
- Add centralized error-handling middleware specifically after file upload routes.

**Example:**
```typescript
router.post('/register-step2', upload.fields([...]), (err, req, res, next) => {
    if (err) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
    }
    next();
}, registerStep2);
```

## 4. Lack of Input Validation

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Injection attacks**: Accepting unvalidated data (e.g., in registration steps) allows attackers to craft payloads which may lead to SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS, or other forms of abuse.

**Remediation:**  
- Employ validation middleware such as `express-validator` to strictly validate and sanitize incoming data before it reaches controllers.

**Example:**
```typescript
router.post('/register-step1', registrationValidator, registerStep1);
```

---

## 5. Development Test Endpoints in Production

**Vulnerability:**  
- **Exposure of sensitive/debug endpoints**: Having `/test` endpoints available in production can leak internal state or enable attackers to probe the application.

**Remediation:**  
- Restrict test/debug routes to run only in development environments.

**Example:**
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    router.get('/test', ...);
}
```

---

## 6. Unused/Incorrect Import Paths (TypeScript)

**Vulnerability:**  
- While not a direct security exploit, importing with incorrect suffixes or unused modules can obfuscate dead code, potentially causing confusion or maintenance issues and may lead to unintentionally exposing or including insecure modules.

**Remediation:**  
- Always import only what is used, and use correct import paths (especially in TypeScript).

# Summary Table

| Vulnerability                          | Severity   | Remediation                          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Unrestricted/unsafe file uploads        | High       | File type/size limits, path config   |
| Insecure profile access (IDOR)          | High       | Authorization checks                 |
| Unhandled multer errors                 | Medium     | Error-handling middleware            |
| No input validation                     | High       | Use validation middleware            |
| Test endpoints exposed                  | Medium     | Restrict to development environment  |
| Import issues (dead code)               | Low        | Remove unused/correct imports        |

## Conclusion

The code contains several security vulnerabilities, primarily in file-handling, authentication/authorization, and input validation. These expose the system to denial-of-service, unauthorized information disclosure, injection, and other risks. Immediate remediation per above recommendations is required to ensure the safety and integrity of the application.
