# High-Level Documentation for `src/routes/studentroutes.ts`

## Purpose

This file defines HTTP routes for student-related features in an Express.js web application. It sets up endpoints for student registration (multi-step), profile access, file uploads, and testing, integrating security and request processing middleware.

---

## Key Components

1. **Imports**
   - **Controllers**: Functions performing the actual business logic for each route.
   - **Middleware**: Authentication and security checks for protected endpoints.
   - **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads during registration.

2. **File Upload Configuration**
   - Uses Multer for file handling; upload location and file constraints should be centrally configured (ideally via environment variables), and uploads should be validated for type and size for security.

3. **Student Registration Routes**
   - Registration occurs in multiple steps; endpoints named accordingly. Express route handlers invoke controller logic and may use Multer for uploading identity documents/photos.

4. **Authentication & Profile Access**
   - Profile endpoints (`/profile`, `/profile/:studentId`) require authentication; intended to allow a logged-in student (or an admin) to view profile data.

5. **Testing/Debugging Route**
   - A `/test` endpoint exists, intended for development/debugging, and should be conditionally available only in non-production environments.

6. **Security & Validation**
   - Uses authentication middleware but must also ensure proper authorization (e.g., that students cannot view others' profiles unless permitted).
   - Input validation middleware is recommended for all data-modifying routes to maintain data integrity.

7. **Error Handling**
   - File upload errors (e.g., invalid type/size) should be caught and appropriately returned to the client rather than crashing the application.

## Best Practices (As Implied/Recommended)

- **Configuration Management**: Avoid hardcoding environment-specific parameters.
- **RESTful Design**: Use resource-oriented and semantically correct endpoint naming.
- **Security**: Validate all access and sanitize inputs, restrict file types/sizes, and conditionally expose debug routes.
- **Maintainability**: Remove unused code and standardize import syntax for TypeScript.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error responses for all middleware failures.

## Typical Route Examples

- `POST /students/register/step1` – First registration step, input validation required.
- `POST /students/register/step2` – Second registration step, handles file uploads.
- `GET /students/profile/:studentId` – Returns student profile, with authentication & authorization checks.
- `GET /test` – Only available in development; used for debugging.

## Summary

This routing file orchestrates student-related endpoint handling in an Express.js app, integrating authentication, input validation, and secure file uploads. Key improvements include central configuration, thorough data validation, authorization, and environment-sensitive debugging utilities. Ideal use ensures maintainable, secure, and industry-compliant routing practices.
