# High-Level Documentation: `studentroutes.ts`

This module defines Express routes for student user management in a web backend. Key functionalities and design patterns:

### 1. **Registration Workflow**
- **Step 1:** Basic registration route (`/register-step1`), which processes initial student data.
- **Step 2:** Extended registration route (`/register-step2`) supporting file uploads (profile picture, ID card) via the Multer middleware.

### 2. **Authentication & Profile Management**
- **Login:** Authentication endpoint for students.
- **Profile Access:** 
  - `/profile` allows authenticated students to view their profile.
  - `/profile/:studentId` enables access to a profile by student ID, protected by authentication middleware.

### 3. **Email Verification**
- `/verify-email` endpoint for confirming a userâ€™s email address, typically triggered by a verification link.

### 4. **File Upload Management**
- Utilizes Multer to handle multipart file uploads for registration, storing files locally in an `uploads/` directory.

### 5. **Middleware Usage**
- Applies a custom `authMiddleware` to protect sensitive routes (profile access).
- Incorporates Multer middleware for endpoints requiring file upload processing.

### 6. **Test/Diagnostics Endpoint**
- `/test` endpoint exists for confirming that student routes are operational.

### 7. **Controller Delegation**
- Route handlers mainly delegate processing logic to controller functions for separation of concerns and maintainability.

## **Security and Design Highlights**
- Ensures certain routes are authenticated.
- Facilitates safe handling of user registration and profile updates.
- Implements file upload workflows, though safeguards (file type/size checks) should be reviewed.
- Maintains modular structure with clear separation between routing, middleware, and controller logic.

## **Recommended Practices (to be verified in implementation)**
- Validate and sanitize all user input in controllers.
- Restrict uploaded file types and sizes.
- Apply strict authentication and authorization checks, especially for routes with dynamic parameters (`:studentId`).
- Prevent public access to uploaded files.
- Hide diagnostic/test endpoints before production deployment.
- Ensure error handling does not leak sensitive server information.
- Keep dependencies (Express, Multer) up-to-date for security patches.
