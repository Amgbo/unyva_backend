# Code Review Report

## File: `middleware/multer.ts`

### 1. Directory existence check

**Issue:**  
The code uses a hardcoded relative path `'uploads/'` in the `destination` without making sure the folder exists. If `uploads/` does not exist, Multer will throw an error.

**Recommendation:**  
Ensure the directory exists before passing it to the callback. Preferably, check and create the folder if missing.

**Suggested pseudo code:**
```typescript
import fs from 'fs';

destination: (req, file, cb) => {
  const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, '../uploads/');
  if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
  }
  cb(null, uploadDir);
},
```

### 2. Usage of `__dirname` for absolute path

**Issue:**  
Using a relative path like `'uploads/'` can lead to issues if the working directory changes (for example, when running from another location).

**Recommendation:**  
Use `__dirname` with `path.join` to create an absolute path.

**Suggested pseudo code:**
```typescript
const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, '../uploads/');
cb(null, uploadDir);
```

### 3. uuid and filename construction

**Issue:**  
Although the code uses `uuidv4` for uniqueness, there is a possible risk of filename extension issues or non-ASCII characters not handled properly. Consider normalizing the filename.

**Recommendation:**  
Sanitize the extension using `path.extname` only and avoid using the full filename.

**Suggested pseudo code:**
```typescript
const fileExt = path.extname(file.originalname);
const uniqueName = `${uuidv4()}${fileExt}`;
cb(null, uniqueName);
```

*This is already mostly present, but ensure not to use full original filename for security.*

---

### 4. Export best practices

**Issue:**  
Using `export const upload = ...` is good if you only export one thing, but if this middleware will be extended, consider `export default upload;` for flexibility.

**Recommendation:**  
For now, allowed as is unless there will be more exports.

---

### 5. Type annotations and strictness (TypeScript)

**Issue:**  
Callback arguments in functions (in `destination` and `filename`) should have proper type annotations to abide by TypeScript best practices.

**Recommendation:**  
Explicitly type the function parameters.

**Suggested pseudo code:**
```typescript
destination: (req: Express.Request, file: Express.Multer.File, cb: (error: Error | null, destination: string) => void) => { /*...*/ }

filename: (req: Express.Request, file: Express.Multer.File, cb: (error: Error | null, filename: string) => void) => { /*...*/ }
```

## Summary Table

| Issue                                 | Severity | Recommendation                |
|----------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Directory existence check              | High     | Add folder existence check    |
| Use absolute path for uploads          | Medium   | Use `__dirname` and `path.join` |
| Filename sanitization                  | Low      | Apply `path.extname` only     |
| Type annotations for functions         | Medium   | Add appropriate types         |
| Export pattern                         | Low      | Consider `default` if relevant|

# Example Combined Corrected Pseudo Code Snippet

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
// ...existing imports

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req: Express.Request, file: Express.Multer.File, cb: (error: Error|null, destination: string) => void) => {
    const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, '../uploads/');
    if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
    }
    cb(null, uploadDir);
  },
  filename: (req: Express.Request, file: Express.Multer.File, cb: (error: Error|null, filename: string) => void) => {
    const ext = path.extname(file.originalname);
    const uniqueName = `${uuidv4()}${ext}`;
    cb(null, uniqueName);
  },
});
```

## Additional Notes
- Always ensure your uploads folder is excluded from version control if sensitive information may be stored.
- Consider adding file type and size validation within Multerâ€™s configuration.
- Implement error handling for unexpected failures in your middleware stack.
