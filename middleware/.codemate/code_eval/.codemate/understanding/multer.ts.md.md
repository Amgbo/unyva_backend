# High-Level Documentation: `middleware/multer.ts`

## Purpose

Configures and exports a Multer middleware for handling file uploads in a Node.js application, enforcing storage strategy, file naming conventions, and basic security controls.

---

## Main Functional Components

### 1. Disk Storage Configuration

- **Destination Directory:**  
  - Stores uploaded files in an `uploads/` directory.
  - Ensures this directory exists, or creates it at runtime if missing.
  - Uses cross-platform path resolution with `path.join()`.

- **Filename Generation:**  
  - Generates unique filenames for uploaded files using UUIDs to prevent conflicts.

---

### 2. Security and Validation

- **File Type Restriction:**  
  - Restricts uploads to specific inline types (e.g., only images such as png, jpg, gif).
  - Uses Multer `fileFilter` to validate MIME types.

- **File Size Limit:**  
  - Prevents DoS attacks by limiting individual uploaded file size (e.g., 5MB).

---

### 3. Error Handling

- **Error Management:**  
  - Relies on application-level middleware to handle and report upload errors, such as invalid file type or size exceedance.

---

### 4. Module Export

- **Export Pattern:**  
  - The configured Multer instance is exported for integration into Express route handlers.

---

## Best Practices Followed

- Ensures destination directory exists and is correctly resolved for any OS.
- Enforces unique file naming.
- Implements basic security by filtering file types and limiting file size.
- Leaves error handling extensible for the consuming application.
- Organizes imports efficiently, using only required packages.

---

## Intended Usage

Import and use the exported Multer middleware in Express route handlers to manage secure, reliable file uploads.

---

## Reference Standards

Adheres to recommendations from:
- Multer documentation
- Node.js path handling
- Security guidelines for file uploads

---

**Note:** Always review and adjust the file type whitelist, size limits, and error handling to match your applicationâ€™s security requirements before deploying to production.
