# Security Vulnerability Assessment Report  
**File:** `middleware/multer.ts`  
**Purpose:** Multer file upload configuration

---

## 1. Arbitrary File Uploads (RCE, Data Exposure Risk)
**Vulnerability:**  
- The code appears to accept any file type, as there is **no file type or extension/mime validation**. This allows users to upload potentially malicious files, such as executables, scripts, or webshells.  
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), malware upload, storing illegal content, or browser exploit attacks if files are publicly served.

**Recommendation:**  
- Add a `fileFilter` to only allow safe, necessary MIME types (e.g. only images).
- Example:
  ```typescript
  const allowedTypes = ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/gif'];
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
      if (allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
          cb(null, true);
      } else {
          cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
      }
  }
  ```

---

## 2. Large File Uploads (Denial-of-Service Risk)
**Vulnerability:**  
- There is **no limit on file size**. Attackers can upload extremely large files to exhaust disk space or memory.
- **Impact:** Denial-of-Service (DoS), resource exhaustion, application/server crash.

**Recommendation:**
- Set explicit `limits` on file size.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5MB
  ```

---

## 3. Unrestricted Upload Path (Path Traversal Risk)
**Vulnerability:**  
- If the filename or storage logic is not securely handled, there's potential for directory traversal exploits.  
- **Current filename practice unknown:** Be wary if the original filename or any user-supplied value is used as-is.
- **Impact:** Overwriting critical files, unauthorized file writes, privilege escalation.

**Recommendation:**  
- Never use user-supplied or raw `file.originalname` in saved file paths. Always sanitize or replace with a generated value (like a UUID).
- Example:
  ```typescript
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
      // always ignore `file.originalname` for file path
      cb(null, uuidv4() + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
  ```

---

## 4. Unsafe Upload Directory Handling
**Vulnerability:**  
- If the `uploads/` directory does not exist, errors might leak sensitive info or cause unexpected crashes.

**Recommendation:**
- Always check and create the upload directory securely using Node.js API, and use `path.join()` for portable and safe path concatenation.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  import fs from 'fs';
  import path from 'path';
  const dir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'uploads');
  if (!fs.existsSync(dir)) fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
  ```

---

## 5. No Error Handling / Crash on Upload Failures
**Vulnerability:**  
- Without custom error-handling middleware, multer errors (e.g., file too large, invalid file type) may leak stack traces or disrupt server stability.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always add an error-handling middleware to control upload errors and mask implementation details.

---

## 6. Potential Over-Disclosure via Uploaded File Serving
**Note:**  
- If uploaded files are served directly via static file serving (like Express's `express.static('uploads')`), **ensure that no sensitive or executable files are ever allowed** into that directory.

| 2  | No upload size limit                 | High              | Set `limits.fileSize`            |
| 3  | Unsafe filename usage                | High              | Always sanitize/generate names   |
| 4  | Unsafe upload path handling          | Medium            | Use `path.join`, exists check    |
| 5  | No error handling                    | Medium            | Custom error middleware          |
| 6  | Direct serving of uploaded files     | Medium/High       | Restrict and sanitize content    |

# Final Remediation Example (Pseudo-code)

```typescript
import multer from 'multer';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'uploads');
if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
}

const upload = multer({
    storage: multer.diskStorage({
        destination: (req, file, cb) => cb(null, uploadDir),
        filename: (req, file, cb) => cb(null, uuidv4() + path.extname(file.originalname))
    }),
    fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
        const allowed = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
        if (allowed.includes(file.mimetype)) cb(null, true);
        else cb(new Error('Invalid file type: only images allowed'), false);
    },
    limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }
});
```

**ACTION**:  
Review and apply the above practices before deploying file upload features. Improperly secured uploads are a top root cause of major web application breaches.
