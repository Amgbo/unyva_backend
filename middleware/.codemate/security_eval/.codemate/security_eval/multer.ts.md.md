# Security Vulnerability Report for `middleware/multer.ts`

This report outlines the security vulnerabilities found in the provided multer-based file upload middleware code.

---

## 1. **Missing File Type Validation**

**Issue:**  
The code does not restrict the types of files users can upload. Attackers can upload dangerous files (e.g., `.exe`, `.sh`, `.js`), risking server compromise or client attacks.

**Mitigation:**  
Implement Multer's `fileFilter` to allow only safe types (such as image files):

```typescript
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    return cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
  }
  cb(null, true);
};
```

---

## 2. **Path Traversal Risks**

**Issue:**  
The upload path is statically set (e.g., `'uploads/'`). If this path ever becomes user-controllable, attackers could use path traversal (`../`) to overwrite other files.

**Mitigation:**  
Always use a hardcoded, absolute path for the uploads directory and never derive it from user input, e.g.:

```typescript
cb(null, path.join(__dirname, '../uploads/'));
```

---

## 3. **File Overwrite Risk / Insufficient Collision Prevention**

**Issue:**  
Filenames include a UUID, but the extension comes from user input (`file.originalname`). There is a low risk of name collision and allowing malicious extensions.

**Mitigation:**  
Ensure file names are truly unique. Sanitize extensions and log uploads to detect collisions.

---

## 4. **Uploaded File Access Control Missing**

**Issue:**  
Files are saved in `'uploads/'`. If the server serves this directory statically (e.g., via `express.static`), attackers can list and download arbitrary files.

**Mitigation:**  
Do not serve the upload directory without access controls. Restrict downloads to authorized users only.

---

## 5. **Directory Creation Not Guaranteed**

**Issue:**  
The comment suggests you must manually create the upload directory. If it doesn't exist, Multer fails and may leak filesystem details in error messages.

**Mitigation:**  
On server startup, ensure (and log) that the upload directory exists and has safe permissions; never let Multer silently create it.

---

## 6. **Trusting User-Supplied Extensions**

**Issue:**  
Extensions are copied from `file.originalname`, which attackers can set to anything (e.g., double extensions: `image.jpg.exe`).

**Mitigation:**  
Do not trust the incoming extension. Instead, map the mimetype to the correct extension after validating the type.

## Vulnerability Summary Table

| Vulnerability                | Severity | Recommendation                         |
|------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Missing file type validation | High     | Implement `fileFilter`/whitelist types |
| Path traversal               | Medium   | Use hardcoded, absolute directories    |
| Overwrite/collision risk     | Low      | Use fully unique, sanitized filenames  |
| File access control missing  | High     | Never serve uploaded files directly    |
| Directory existence          | Medium   | Ensure upload dir exists securely      |
| Extension trust              | High     | Ignore original extension, sanitize    |

---

## Immediate Security Actions

- Use Multer's `fileFilter` to whitelist types.
- Only serve uploaded files after authentication/authorization.
- Never trust user filenames or extensions; always sanitize.
- Create and secure upload directories on startup, not at runtime.
